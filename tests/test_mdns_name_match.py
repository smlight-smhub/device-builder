"""Regression tests for the mDNS service-name → device lookup.

mDNS broadcasts ``<device-name>._esphomelib._tcp.local.``; the
left-hand label is the device's ``esphome.name`` verbatim. Modern
configs use ``friendly_name_slugify``-style names with hyphens
(``apollo-r-pro-1-eth-5938e0``); the previous code converted those
hyphens to underscores before lookup, so every modern device's
mDNS announcement landed on a non-existent ``apollo_r_pro_...`` key
and the device stayed marked Unknown forever.
