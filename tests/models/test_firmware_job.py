"""Tests for ``FirmwareJob`` model methods.

The ``FirmwareJob`` dataclass is mostly pure data, but a few
methods on it carry meaningful behaviour:

- ``reset()`` — called by the persistence-load path when a
  ``RUNNING`` job survives a dashboard restart and is being
  re-queued for a fresh run. Lives on the model rather than as
  a free helper so a future per-run field added to
  ``FirmwareJob`` lands right next to the method that has to
  clear it.
