"""
Listener lifecycle tests for the remote-build feature.

Exercises the real :func:`DeviceBuilder._maybe_start_remote_build_site`
and :func:`DeviceBuilder.reload_remote_build_identity` hooks:
default-skip when ``enabled=False``; bind when ``enabled=True``;
fail-soft on bind error; advertise the OS-assigned port for
ephemeral binds; fall forward off a taken configured port and
advertise the bound one; warn on HA-addon mode; rebuild the listener
(now serving the peer-link Noise WS at
``/remote-build/peer-link``) on identity rotation.

Pin-vs-handshake verification is the pairing flow's job
(``test_remote_build_peer_link.py``).
