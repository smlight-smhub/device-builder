End-to-end: transparent install — submit_job + fan-out + download_artifacts on one session.

#568 wired the offloader-side ``firmware/install`` through
:func:`helpers.build_scheduler.pick_build_path` and extended
:func:`remote_runner.run_remote_job` to run both sides of a
transparent install on one paired session:

* ``client.submit_job(target="compile")`` to dispatch the
  compile to the receiver;
* the receiver-side :class:`JobFanout` translates its local
  firmware queue's ``JOB_*`` lifecycle into wire
  ``job_state_changed`` frames;
* on receiver-completed the offloader pulls the artifact
  tarball back via ``client.download_artifacts(job_id=...)``
  and flashes locally.

Existing e2e tests cover each piece in isolation —
``test_submit_job.py`` (submit_job ack + extracted YAML),
``test_submit_job_fanout.py`` (single ``JOB_STARTED`` →
``OFFLOADER_JOB_STATE_CHANGED``), ``test_download_artifacts.py``
(download_artifacts round-trip from a pre-seeded receiver job).
What transparent install introduced is the **combination**: the same paired
Noise session has to carry submit_job, then the lifecycle
fan-out, then download_artifacts, all keyed on the same
``(offloader dashboard_id, offloader-side job_id)`` correlation
through to the receiver's
``ArtifactsDownloadSender._find_remote_job`` linear scan over
``firmware.state.jobs``. A regression that breaks the correlation
between the submit-side and download-side reads, or one that
fails to keep the session healthy across two application-
message types, would slip past the per-flow tests but surface
on this combined round-trip.

The harness's per-side firmware controller stays a
``MagicMock`` (single source of truth: ``make_remote_build_controller``
in ``tests/conftest.py``) — we synthesise the receiver-side
``JOB_*`` events here rather than running a real compile
subprocess. The point is pinning the wire shape across the
two-flow combination, not the build pipeline. Wall-clock stays
sub-second.

The local upload subprocess that the production runner would
spawn after ``download_artifacts`` is out of scope here too —
unit tests in ``test_remote_runner.py`` already pin the
download + extract + spawn chain; the e2e variant stops at
"both wire flows ran on one session and the artifacts decoded
on the offloader side."

    The bug this test pins: previously the receiver only
    broadcast ``queue_status`` on its own firmware queue
    transitions (``_on_firmware_queue_transition``). A
    cold-connected offloader that paired before the receiver
    built anything never observed an idle entry, and the
    install scheduler's ``pick_build_path`` requires an entry
    in ``_peer_queue_status`` to consider a pairing eligible —
    so ``firmware/install`` silently fell back to LOCAL on
    every paired receiver. The fix has the receiver send a
    one-shot ``queue_status`` to a freshly-registered session
    inside :meth:`register_peer_link_session`.

    The previous shape of this test pre-seeded
    ``offloader.state.peer_queue_status[pin]`` to model the
    transition-driven path, masking the cold-connect gap. The

    waiting on its ``OFFLOADER_QUEUE_STATUS_CHANGED`` event
    (fired by the receive loop after parsing the receiver's

    ``esphome upload --file`` subprocess (out of scope —

    code translation in isolation).

    1. ``client.submit_job(target="compile")`` with a real
       bundle. Receiver-side dispatch lands a queued
       :class:`FirmwareJob` whose ``remote_peer`` matches the
       harness's offloader and ``remote_job_id`` echoes the
       offloader-side tag.
    2. Fire ``JOB_QUEUED`` on the receiver bus so
       :class:`JobFanout` populates its
       ``(offloader, offloader-side job_id)`` correlation cache.
    3. Fire ``JOB_STARTED`` → fan-out emits a ``running``
       ``job_state_changed`` over the same paired session;
       offloader's receive loop fires
       ``OFFLOADER_JOB_STATE_CHANGED``.
    4. Fire ``JOB_COMPLETED`` → terminal ``completed`` frame
       lands on the offloader bus.
    5. The receiver-side recorded job's ``status`` is flipped
       to ``COMPLETED`` so
       :meth:`ArtifactsDownloadSender._find_remote_job` accepts
       it for download.
    6. ``paired_instances.offloader.download_artifacts(pin,
       job_id=<offloader-side id>)`` runs on the same session
       and returns the unpacked artifact set.

    Assertions cover the two-flow contract end-to-end:

    * ``submit_job_ack{accepted: true}`` flows back; the
      receiver's recorded job carries the correlation fields.
    * ``OFFLOADER_JOB_STATE_CHANGED`` events land for the
      ``running`` then ``completed`` transitions (a leading
      ``queued`` from JOB_QUEUED may precede them; this test
      polls for the named statuses rather than asserting count).
      Both echo the offloader-supplied ``job_id`` and the live
      ``pin_sha256`` from the harness's handshake.
    * ``download_artifacts`` returns the StorageJSON +
      ``idedata`` + base64-enveloped image bytes the receiver
      packed; the artifact set survives the round-trip on the
      same Noise channel that just carried submit_job + the
