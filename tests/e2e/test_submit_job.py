"""
End-to-end: ``submit_job`` round-trip across the live peer-link with a real bundle.

Closes the gap that let the "Bundle file not found" regression
(receiver-side bundle path collision with
:func:`esphome.bundle.prepare_bundle_for_compile`'s wipe step)
ship despite the unit suite passing. The unit tests in
``tests/test_remote_build_submit_job.py`` stub
:func:`esphome.bundle.prepare_bundle_for_compile` with a
trivial pass-through, so the upstream wipe-then-extract
semantics never ran against the production bundle layout; the
e2e harness here drives the real upstream function against a
real bundle written by the real receive loop, so a regression
in that seam surfaces on the ack instead of in production.

The chain:

  offloader-side :meth:`PeerLinkClient.submit_job`
                       →  ``submit_job`` header
                          (real Noise AEAD)
                       →  ``submit_job_chunk`` frames
                          (chunked + base64-enveloped by
                          :func:`chunk_bundle`)
                       →  receiver-side ``_run_session_loops``
                          receive loop
                       →  :meth:`SubmitJobReceiver.handle_submit_job`
                          + :meth:`handle_submit_job_chunk`
                          run the real :class:`BundleAssembler`,
                          verify SHA-256, write the assembled
                          tarball to disk
                       →  real
                          :func:`esphome.bundle.prepare_bundle_for_compile`
                          wipes target_dir's non-preserved
                          entries, extracts the bundle, returns
                          the absolute YAML path
                       →  ``firmware._create_job`` + ``_enqueue``
                          land the :class:`FirmwareJob` with
                          ``remote_peer=offloader_dashboard_id``
                       →  ``submit_job_ack{accepted: true}`` rides
                          back to the offloader

The remote runner additionally spawns the ``esphome bundle``
CLI subprocess to build *bundle_bytes* from a YAML on disk; we
bypass that step and call :meth:`PeerLinkClient.submit_job`
with a pre-built in-test bundle so the test stays focused on
the receiver-side
gap. The subprocess invocation is upstream esphome's contract,
covered separately by tests on :func:`build_yaml_bundle`.
