"""
End-to-end harness for the remote-build offload feature (issue #106).

Two real :class:`RemoteBuildController` instances stood up
side-by-side — one acting as the receiver (peer-link listener
bound on a real TCP port via :class:`aiohttp.test_utils.TestServer`),
one acting as the offloader (long-lived
:class:`PeerLinkClient` connecting to the receiver). Both run on
real :class:`EventBus` instances so per-mutation events flow
through the same wire surface a production frontend would
subscribe to.

Tests built on top of this harness exercise behaviour that
spans both sides of the wire — handshake → pair → peer-link
session → application messages (5b/5c/5d) → bundle upload +
firmware download (later phases). Single-side unit tests in
``test_remote_build_peer_link.py`` /
``test_remote_build_peer_link_client.py`` already pin the
per-side wire shapes; the harness's value is catching mismatches
between the two (event payload contracts, dashboard_id collisions,
terminate flow with both sides observing).

The harness drives the real pair flow end-to-end (no
dict-mocking shortcuts): receiver opens its pairing window,
offloader runs ``preview_pair`` + ``request_pair`` over real
Noise XX handshakes, receiver calls ``approve_peer``, then
the offloader's pair-status listener observes the flip and
spawns the long-lived peer-link client. Tests built on top of
``paired_instances`` start from "both sides have an APPROVED
row, the long-lived peer-link session is open, ready for
application messages."

    * ``offloader``: the offloader-role dashboard's offloader-side

    The full handles (``receiver_handles`` / ``offloader_handles``)
    are exposed for tests that need both halves of a single
    dashboard or the convenience ``start`` / ``stop`` lifecycle.

    :meth:`wait_until_session_opened` is the single conventional

    call it before their assertions instead of polling the
