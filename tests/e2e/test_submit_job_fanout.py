"""
End-to-end: receiver-side ``JOB_*`` events fan out to the offloader bus.

Exercises the wire-round-trip path that the unit tests
in ``tests/test_remote_build_job_fanout.py`` only cover up to
``send_app_frame``-was-called. The harness here drives a real
peer-link session, so every assertion below proves the chain
that production runs end-to-end:

  receiver-side bus  →  JobFanout listener
                     →  peer-link ``job_state_changed`` /
                        ``job_output`` frame (real Noise AEAD)
                     →  offloader-side ``_run_session_loops``
                        receive loop
                     →  ``_dispatch_job_state_changed`` /
                        ``_dispatch_job_output``
                     →  offloader-side bus
                        (``OFFLOADER_JOB_STATE_CHANGED`` /
                        ``OFFLOADER_JOB_OUTPUT``)

The receiver-side firmware controller stays a ``MagicMock`` (the
harness's default) — we don't need a real build pipeline to fire
synthetic ``JOB_*`` events on the controller's bus, and a real
build would balloon the wall-clock to multi-minute. The point of
the e2e variant is the wire shape, not the queue plumbing.

The ``submit_job`` accept path itself (header → chunks → ack) is
covered by the receiver-side unit tests
(``test_remote_build_submit_job.py``) and the offloader-side
unit tests (``test_remote_build_peer_link_client.py``); the
value-add of an end-to-end submit_job test is
catching wire-shape mismatches between the two halves, which
``test_pair_and_session.py`` already pins for the handshake +
session lifecycle. A submit_job e2e test is the natural next
follow-up once the receiver-side firmware controller can be
swapped for a recording stub without coupling the harness to
``DeviceBuilder``.
