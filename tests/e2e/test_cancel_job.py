End-to-end: offloader-driven cancel routes to receiver-side firmware.cancel.

Exercises the 5d ``cancel_job`` reverse-direction wire path. The
unit tests in ``test_remote_build_peer_link_client.py`` cover the
offloader-side ``PeerLinkClient.cancel_job`` send in isolation;
the unit tests in ``test_remote_build_controller.py`` cover the
receiver-side ``handle_cancel_job`` handler with a synthetic
frame; this PR's tests pin the wire round-trip across both halves
so a wire-shape mismatch on either side surfaces here rather than
slipping past two unit suites that pass on the same drift.

The chain:

  offloader-side cancel translation (the remote runner's
  ``_send_cancel_or_finalise``)
                       →  ``PeerLinkClient.cancel_job``
                       →  peer-link ``cancel_job`` frame
                          (real Noise AEAD)
                       →  receiver-side ``_run_session_loops``
                          receive loop
                       →  ``handle_cancel_job`` resolves
                          ``(remote_peer, remote_job_id)`` →
                          ``firmware_job_id`` via
                          ``JobFanout.resolve_firmware_job_id``
                       →  ``firmware.cancel(job_id=...)``

The receiver-side firmware controller is an :class:`AsyncMock`
on ``db.firmware`` — we don't need a real firmware queue to
verify the cancel landed at the right primitive, and a real
queue would couple this test to the firmware controller's own
state machine. The point of the e2e variant is the wire shape +
the JobFanout correlation; the firmware-cancel side-effect is
already covered by ``test_firmware_controller.py``.
