"""End-to-end coverage for ``DevicesController.search_yaml``.

The new ``yaml/search`` WS command is the dashboard's
"find a string across every YAML in this fleet" surface — the
frontend's full-content search dropdown calls it on every
keystroke (debounced).

Exercises:

- Substring matches across multiple files.
- Per-file cap so one chatty match doesn't drown the rest.
- Total-results cap so an over-broad query stays manageable.
- Case-insensitive default + opt-in case sensitivity.
- Empty / whitespace query short-circuits without iterating.
- Missing file / unreadable file is skipped, not a 500.

The controller iterates ``self._scanner.devices`` and reads
``self._db.settings.rel_path(configuration)`` from disk. The
``make_controller`` fixture wires ``rel_path`` against the
test's ``tmp_path``, so each test just writes YAML files at
the expected paths and pre-populates ``_scanner.devices``.
