"""Tests for the ``devices/edit_friendly_name`` command path.

The command rewrites ``esphome.friendly_name:`` in the source YAML
in-place (no sidecar drift), reusing the same machinery the clone
path is built on. Frontend drives the install half — this command
just lands the YAML edit and triggers a scan.

What we pin:

- happy path: literal-leaf rewrite + scan, returns ``rewritten=True``
- substitution-driven leaf (``friendly_name: ${friendly_name}``)
  redirects through ``substitutions.<var>``
- YAML-special characters (``Bedroom #2``) get safely double-quoted
- idempotent no-op (same value already on the line) skips the
  write and returns ``rewritten=False``
- user-correctable failures raise ``INVALID_ARGS``: blank input,
  missing source, no inline ``esphome.friendly_name`` leaf
