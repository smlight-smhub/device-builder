"""
End-to-end coverage for ``DevicesController.subscribe_reachability``.

Drives the per-device reachability subscription handler with a real
:class:`EventBus` + a real :class:`ReachabilityTracker` + a real
:class:`WebSocketClient` over a mock aiohttp WS. Pin the four
contract pieces:

1. **Initial snapshot** — on subscribe, the client receives one
   ``reachability_state`` event carrying the current per-signal
   freshness, then the ``{"subscribed": True}`` result confirmation.
2. **Per-device filter** — bus events for a *different* device do
   not reach this client.
3. **Live updates** — a fresh observation on the subscribed device
   pushes a follow-up ``reachability_state`` event.
4. **Cancel via stop_stream** — calling ``devices/stop_stream`` with
   the subscription's message_id cancels the handler task and the
   listener detaches (no leak on the bus).

Bonus:
5. ``device_name`` validation — missing or unknown device produces
   a typed ``CommandError`` rather than a silent stream that never
   delivers anything.
6. The mDNS refresh task only ticks when active source is mDNS —
   ping / mqtt-source devices don't get a 60s force-resolve.
