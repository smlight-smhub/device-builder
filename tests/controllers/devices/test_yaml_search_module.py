"""Coverage for ``_yaml_search.search_yaml_devices``.

The end-to-end tests in ``test_search_yaml.py`` exercise the
loop via ``DevicesController.search_yaml`` (lock + cache prune
included). These tests pin the search loop in isolation:

- Substring match shape and the ``(results, live_configurations)``
  return tuple that the controller uses for cache pruning.
- ``case_sensitive`` flag — caller is responsible for pre-lowering
  the needle when False; pin both branches.
- Per-file cap so a chatty match doesn't crowd out other devices.
- Total-results cap stops the walk early; ``live_configurations``
  reflects only the devices actually walked, not the full input
  iterable.
- Empty / matches list → device skipped from results entirely.
- Cache miss (``get_lines`` returns ``None``) → device skipped
  from results, NOT from ``live_configurations`` (we still saw
  the device, just couldn't read its file).
- ``await asyncio.sleep(0)`` between devices — the no-blocking-I/O
  contract: a 100-device fleet's worth of in-memory line scans
  must not run as a single uninterrupted task slice.
