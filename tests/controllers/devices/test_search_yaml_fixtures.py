"""End-to-end ``yaml/search`` against realistic ESPHome YAML fixtures.

The sibling ``test_search_yaml.py`` pins the controller-level
contracts (caps, case, locking, missing-file robustness) using
inlined synthetic YAML — small, focused, fast.

This file targets a different question: does the search behave
correctly against the *kind* of YAML users actually have on disk?
Multi-section configs with comments, anchors-style substitutions,
``!secret`` references, packages, ethernet vs wifi shapes,
``${var}`` interpolation, indented platform blocks. The fixtures
under ``tests/fixtures/yaml_search/`` are anonymised real configs
covering four common shapes:

- ``bluetooth_proxy.yaml`` — esp32-c3 + ``bluetooth_proxy:`` +
  ``esp32_ble_tracker:`` + buttons.
- ``smart_plug.yaml`` — ESP8266 + ``cse7766`` power monitoring +
  ``binary_sensor`` / ``sensor`` / ``switch`` / ``status_led``.
- ``packaged_device.yaml`` — ``packages: remote_package: …`` +
  ``substitutions:`` + ``${name}`` interpolation.
- ``ethernet_proxy.yaml`` — ``ethernet:`` (LAN8720) + ``bluetooth_proxy:``
  + ``time:`` / ``text_sensor:`` / ``sensor:`` / ``switch:``.

Confidence we want from these tests:

- A query for an ESPHome top-level key (``bluetooth_proxy``)
  hits the right subset of the fleet.
- Multi-line matches inside a block (``cse7766``'s
  ``current``/``voltage``/``power``) come back in file order with
  correct line numbers.
- Comment-only matches still surface (the YAML is the source of
  truth, comments included — users grepping for a TODO or a
  magic constant care about them).
- Substitution / package syntax (``${name}``, ``!secret``) is just
  text to the searcher and matches as such.
- Per-file cap kicks in even on a chatty fixture (the smart plug
  has many ``Smart Plug`` matches).
