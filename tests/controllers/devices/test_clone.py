"""Tests for the ``devices/clone`` command path.

Covers the user-correctable failures (collision, empty / equal name,
missing source) as typed ``CommandError(INVALID_ARGS, …)`` so the
clone dialog can show specific messages rather than a generic
"Command failed" fallback. Also covers the happy path: the new YAML
swaps ``esphome.name`` / ``friendly_name``, regenerates the API
encryption key, leaves ``!secret`` indirections alone, and triggers
a scan so the new file shows up in the next ``devices/list``.
