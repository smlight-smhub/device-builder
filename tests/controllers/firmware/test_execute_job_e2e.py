"""End-to-end coverage for ``FirmwareController._execute_job``.

Drives the runner through the public submission API
(``firmware/compile``) rather than calling ``_execute_job``
directly so the test exercises the full path the runner walks
in production:

    enqueue (``compile``) → ``_run_queue`` pops → ``_execute_job``
    → subprocess spawn → stdout streamed line by line → bus.fire
    → exit code + error-pattern verdict → JOB_COMPLETED /
    JOB_FAILED / JOB_CANCELLED broadcast → finally trim + persist

The "subprocess" is a Python one-liner pointed to by
``_esphome_cmd``; each test parametrises the script body to
exercise a different branch of the runner (success, exit-code
failure, exit-0 + error-pattern, mid-stream cancel, progress
parsing, ``No module named 'esphome'`` actionable hint).

Without this file most of ``_execute_job`` (~180 lines, by far
the biggest method in ``FirmwareController``) was uncovered —
every other test in this directory either stubbed the runner
out or exercised a single helper in isolation. A regression in
the spawn / stream / exit-handling chain would silently break
every dashboard build with no test failure.
