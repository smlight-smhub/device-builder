"""Coverage for the smaller load-bearing branches in ``firmware/controller.py``.

Each test pins one specific branch the per-feature suites either
skip or cover only via a deeper helper. Short, surgical tests so
when a branch they protect regresses, the failure clearly names
the missing behaviour.

Surfaces touched here:

- **Public submission**: ``firmware/rename`` happy path (the
  rename-lock suite covers conflict cases but nothing pins the
  enqueue path itself).
- **Stream / follower wiring**: ``follow_job`` raises ValueError
  for an unknown job id, ``follow_jobs`` early-returns when
  ``client`` is None.
- **Runner internals**: queue runner skips a CANCELLED job
  without spawning a subprocess, ``_terminate_job_process``
  is a no-op when no process is bound.
- **Command building**: ``_build_command`` for ``RENAME`` appends
  ``new_name`` as a positional arg.
- **Prune-history dedup**: same-configuration primary-pool entries
  collapse to the newest.
