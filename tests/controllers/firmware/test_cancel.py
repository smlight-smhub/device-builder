"""End-to-end coverage for ``FirmwareController.cancel``.

The handler routes by job status:

- ``QUEUED`` → mark terminal + prune + persist + fire
  ``JOB_CANCELLED`` immediately. The runner never sees the job
  (it was waiting in the queue, not running), so finalisation
  happens here rather than in ``_execute_job``'s ``finally``
  branch.
- ``RUNNING`` → record the cancel intent and terminate the
  subprocess. The runner's ``finally`` block sees the dead
  process, finds the id in ``_cancel_requested``, and finalises
  the job with status ``CANCELLED`` instead of the usual
  ``FAILED``-on-non-zero-exit.
- Already terminal → reject with ``CommandError(INVALID_ARGS)``.
- Unknown ``job_id`` → reject with ``CommandError(NOT_FOUND)``.
- ``RUNNING`` but state out of sync (no lane slot or wrong
  id) → ``RuntimeError``. Defensive guard against a queue that
  thinks a job is running but the runner has moved on. Stays as
  ``RuntimeError`` (server bug, not user input) so the WS
  dispatcher surfaces ``INTERNAL_ERROR``.
