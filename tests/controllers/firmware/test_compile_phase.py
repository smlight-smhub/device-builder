``compile_started_at`` / ``compile_ended_at`` stamping.

The clock starts on the first build line (PlatformIO ``Compiling`` word
markers with no percentage, or raw esp-idf ninja ``[N/M]`` counters with no
``Compiling`` word — both pinned from captured builds) and stops at the
summary banner; the dependency download and an install's flash never count,
and a stray download/flash percentage never starts it.
