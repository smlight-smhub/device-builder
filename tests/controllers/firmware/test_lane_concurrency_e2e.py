"""End-to-end proof that the compile and upload lanes run concurrently.

The whole point of the two-lane queue (esphome discussion #3702): a
network-bound upload must not block the next device's compile. This file
drives both real lane consumers (via ``_run_queue``) against real
subprocesses — an upload that parks in its subprocess on one device while
a compile for another device runs to completion on the compile lane —
and pins that both lanes were occupied at the same time. A regression
that re-serialised the queue (one shared worker) would leave the compile
QUEUED behind the parked upload and trip the timeout here.
