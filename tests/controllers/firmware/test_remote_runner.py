"""
Tests for the source-routed firmware runner branch.

Exercises ``FirmwareController._execute_remote_job``
end-to-end against a real :class:`EventBus`. The test scaffolding
substitutes the bundle build + peer-link client surfaces with
:class:`AsyncMock` shims so the runner's wire-event translation
can be driven deterministically: a test fires a stub
``OFFLOADER_JOB_OUTPUT`` or ``OFFLOADER_JOB_STATE_CHANGED`` and
asserts the matching local ``JOB_*`` translation lands on the
same bus.

The receiver's correlation-id contract (echoes the offloader's
``job_id`` back on every fan-out frame) is built into the
fixtures — every fake event the test fires carries the
offloader-side ``job.job_id``, so the runner's filter accepts
it and exercises the translation path. A mismatched id on a
stray frame from another in-flight remote job is covered by a
separate test that asserts the runner ignores it.

    Cancel landing during the staging executor hops fires ``_terminate_job_process`` post-spawn.

    The runner has two cancel-check sites for this path:

    1. **Pre-spawn early check** in
       ``_fetch_and_run_local_upload`` — covered by
       ``test_fetch_and_run_local_upload_cancel_pre_spawn_skips_subprocess``.
    2. **Post-spawn in-context-manager check** in
       ``_run_upload_subprocess`` — fires when the cancel
       flag was *not* set at the pre-check moment but *is*
       set by the time the spawn returns. The window is the
       executor hops for ``mkdtemp`` + ``firmware_path.write_bytes``
       between the two checks.

    This test races a cancel into that window by patching
    ``firmware_path.write_bytes`` (via ``Path.write_bytes``)
    to flip ``_cancel_requested`` as a side effect — so by
    the time the spawn returns, the in-context check sees
    the flag and fires ``_terminate_job_process``.
