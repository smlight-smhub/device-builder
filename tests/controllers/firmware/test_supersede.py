"""End-to-end coverage for the supersede-on-resubmit flow.

When the user re-submits a firmware operation for a device that
already has a job in flight, ``_supersede_active_jobs`` cancels
the predecessor so the all-jobs panel only shows one active
entry per device. The flow is wired into ``_enqueue`` (after
``JOB_QUEUED`` fires for the new job, before persistence), so
the user-visible contract is:

- Submit two compiles for the same configuration in sequence:
  the first lands as ``CANCELLED``, the second as ``QUEUED``.
- Submit two compiles for *different* configurations: both
  stay ``QUEUED`` (supersede is per-configuration).
- A running job for the same configuration gets cancelled
  the same way (the runner's ``_terminate_job_process``
  fires).
- The ``exclude_job_id`` guard keeps the new submission from
  cancelling itself — without it, ``_supersede_active_jobs``
  would iterate ``self.state.jobs.values()``, find the new
  ``QUEUED`` entry, and immediately cancel it.

Drives through public API only — submit via ``compile`` /
``reset_build_env``, assert via ``get_jobs``. The supersede
happens as a side effect of the second ``_enqueue``; tests
don't call ``_supersede_active_jobs`` directly.
