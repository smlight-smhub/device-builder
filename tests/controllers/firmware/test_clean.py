"""End-to-end coverage for ``FirmwareController.clean``.

Same shape as ``test_compile.py`` — ``clean`` is the smallest
submission handler after ``compile``: no port, no rename target,
just configuration → queued ``CLEAN`` job. The pieces it calls
are covered in isolation elsewhere
(``_validate_configuration_boundary`` in
``test_traversal_validation.py``, ``_create_job`` / ``_enqueue``
lifecycles across the broader suite); this file pins the
wiring.

Pinning matters because ``clean`` and ``compile`` share an
identical control-flow shape, and a refactor that "unifies" the
two handlers is the obvious accident that would silently flip
``CLEAN`` to ``COMPILE`` (or vice versa) without any production
test catching it.
