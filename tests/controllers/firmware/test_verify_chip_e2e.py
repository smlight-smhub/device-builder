"""End-to-end coverage for ``FirmwareController._verify_chip``.

Runner-level integration test. Drives the chip-id pre-flight by
submitting via the public ``firmware/install`` and
``firmware/upload`` handlers, then ticking the runner via
``_run_queue`` to pump the queue. The chip-id helper itself is
never called directly — observable side effects (job status,
``job.error`` message, JOB_FAILED / JOB_COMPLETED broadcasts,
and the recorded subprocess invocations) drive the assertions.
``_run_queue`` is the only underscore-prefixed method this file
touches; it's the runner entry point and exists to be driven
in tests this way.

The chip-id check spawns ``[*_find_esptool_cmd(), '--port', <port>,
'chip-id']`` via ``create_subprocess_exec``. The resolved command is
either a sibling ``esptool`` script next to ``sys.executable`` or
``[sys.executable, '-m', 'esptool']`` as a fallback (see
``_find_esptool_cmd`` in ``controllers.firmware.helpers``). Tests
substitute ``create_subprocess_exec`` module-level so each one's
"esptool" output can be controlled while the real subsequent build
still runs through the same wrapper (substitute returns a no-op
success-exit script for non-esptool calls).

The expected chip variant comes from a real StorageJSON sidecar
seeded via ``write_storage_json`` — ``_verify_chip`` reads
``StorageJSON.target_platform`` directly (the upstream-canonical
chip variant) rather than ``Device.target_platform`` (which now
carries the platform *key*, not the variant). The global
``_core_config_path_in_tmp`` autouse fixture in ``tests/conftest.py``
pins ``CORE.config_path`` onto ``tmp_path`` so production
``resolve_storage_path`` resolves to
``tmp_path/.esphome/storage/<configuration>.json`` — the same path
``write_storage_json`` writes to. No per-module redirect required.

Branches the runner depends on:

- Chip matches → no error, build proceeds, status COMPLETED.
- Chip mismatch (parametrised over ``install`` AND ``upload``)
  → ``ValueError`` with the chip-mismatch message inside
  ``_execute_job``'s generic ``except Exception``, status
  FAILED, JOB_FAILED carries the message. Both job types must
  trigger the check or a regression that drops one would let
  wrong-chip flashes through.
- esptool output without "Detecting chip type..." line → falls
  through (logged as warning), build proceeds.
- Non-serial port shapes (``OTA``, IPv4, hostname, Windows
  ``COMx``) → no esptool call (the helper only probes
  ``/dev/*`` paths).
- StorageJSON missing → skip the chip check, build still runs
  (pre-compile install has no compile-time truth to verify
  against; esphome's own flash error catches a wrong-chip case).
- StorageJSON with empty ``target_platform`` → skip the chip
  check, build still runs.

Without these the chip-id pre-flight (~54 lines, the longest
helper after ``_execute_job``) had zero direct or indirect
coverage.
