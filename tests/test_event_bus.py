"""Tests for the synchronous ``EventBus`` core.

The bus is exercised heavily by every controller test that fires
events, but the *exception-isolation* branch — one listener
raising must not abort delivery to its peers — has no direct
coverage. Pin it: a noisy listener can't take the whole fan-out
down with it.
