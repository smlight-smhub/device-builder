"""
Strict-pause behaviour for the ICMP ping loop.

Mirrors the legacy ``esphome.dashboard.status.ping`` /
``web_server.py`` pair where ICMP only fired while
``self._subscribers`` was non-empty (the new dashboard had been
sweeping unconditionally — bug). Pins:

* with no presence gate, the loop runs as before (legacy /
  unit-test parity)
* with a wired ``SubscriberPresence``, ``_ping_loop`` parks
  before the sweep until the first subscriber arrives
* the 0→1 subscriber transition wakes the loop within one
  scheduling tick — no waiting out the sweep interval
* the 1→0 transition lets the next iteration park again so a
  burst of disconnects doesn't keep ICMP looping
