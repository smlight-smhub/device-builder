"""
Tests for the reference-counted subscriber-presence gate.

The gate is the small primitive that lets the ICMP ping loop park
while no dashboard client is subscribed (closing the regression
from the legacy dashboard's ``ping_request`` /
``self._subscribers`` pair). These tests pin the count + gate
contract a consumer relies on:

* increment on entry, decrement on exit (success or raise)
* 0→1 transition wakes every awaiter on ``wait_for_subscriber``
* 1→0 transition re-arms the gate so the next awaiter parks again
* ``has_subscribers`` mirrors the count's bool truthiness
