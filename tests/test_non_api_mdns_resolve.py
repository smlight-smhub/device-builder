"""Tests for the non-API mDNS hostname-resolve fallback.

Devices whose YAML doesn't load the ``api`` integration
(web_server-only, MQTT-only, OTA-only configs) never broadcast on
``_esphomelib._tcp.local.``. The state monitor's
``ServiceBrowser`` callback never fires for them, and on networks
where ICMP is filtered the ping fallback can't pick them up
either — the indicator stays UNKNOWN forever even though the
device is reachable.

``_resolve_non_api_mdns_targets`` issues an active mDNS A-record
query every sweep for that subset of devices. Mirrors the legacy
dashboard's ``async_refresh_hosts`` path
(``esphome/dashboard/status/mdns.py``).
