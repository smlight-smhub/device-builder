"""Test fixtures shared across the suite.

Currently just wires Blockbuster (https://github.com/cbornet/blockbuster)
in as an autouse fixture so any blocking call made from inside an
asyncio event loop fails the test instead of silently stalling the
loop. The dashboard is async-first; a stray ``time.sleep`` or sync
``open().read()`` on the request path would tank latency without
showing up in the build, so we let CI catch them.

The fixture only activates on Linux — that's what production runs on
(ESPHome container, HA add-on), so it's the only platform where a
blocking call would actually hit users. Windows and macOS just skip
the check; their CI runs are about catching platform-specific
regressions, not async hygiene.
