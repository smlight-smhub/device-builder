"""Drift + shape checks for the split board catalog artefacts.

The board catalog ships as three coordinated files under
``definitions/``: the slim ``boards.index.json`` (picker shape), the
per-board bodies under ``board_bodies/<id>.json`` (lazy-loaded
detail), and the aggregated ``featured_components.index.json`` (read
once at startup by the components controller). These tests pin:

* the three artefacts reassemble back to what the YAML manifests
  produce — i.e. ``sync_boards.py`` is the only translator;
* the slim index strips body-only fields so the picker doesn't pay
  to read them;
* each body file round-trips through ``BoardCatalogEntry.from_dict``
  standalone (lazy-load is safe);
* the featured-components index is consistent with the body files
  it aggregates over.
