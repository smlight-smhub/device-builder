"""Benchmarks for the ``yaml/search`` hot path.

The dashboard's YAML-content search fires once per debounced
keystroke. The actual *work* is the per-file substring scan in
``scan_lines`` — everything else (asyncio dispatch, cache
lookups, event-loop yields) is plumbing whose overhead would
otherwise drown the signal.

These benchmarks call ``scan_lines`` directly, synchronously,
against a representative ~5k-line ESPHome YAML. That isolates
the cost of the per-line work — ``str.lower`` (case-insensitive
default), substring-in check, dict allocation on a hit — so a
regression in the hot path surfaces with a clean number in
CodSpeed instead of getting smeared across asyncio.run +
cache-lock + sleep(0)-yield overhead.

Five shapes:

- *No match, case-insensitive* — the worst case, every line
  lowered and substring-checked, ``str.lower`` per line.
- *No match, case-sensitive* — same shape, no lower. Delta
  against the insensitive run measures the cost of the
  per-line lower; useful signal if we ever cache a pre-lowered
  copy.
- *Common token, capped take* — chatty needle, the match list
  caps at 5 but the scan keeps counting matches to EOF for the
  ``total_matches`` wire field. Pins the count-past-cap path
  (append work bounded, counting not).
- *Fleet of 20x 5k-line* — scaled walk, surfaces any
  per-device fixed cost beyond the line scan itself.

The async ``search_yaml_devices`` end-to-end (with
``YamlSearchCache`` + ``asyncio.run``) lives in the unit-test
suite — including there in CodSpeed would just measure the
event-loop machinery.
