"""Tests for the pure ``helpers/yaml.py`` functions.

The helper module is purely string transforms — no file I/O, no
event-loop concerns — but it's easy to break in subtle ways
because the YAML it edits is unparsed text. The functions covered
here back the clone, friendly-name editor, and add-component
paths.

What we pin:

* ``rewrite_name_or_substitution`` — clone's hostname rewrite,
  with substitution-aware redirect when ``name: ${var}`` shows up.
* ``upsert_yaml_leaf_under_top_block`` — friendly_name editor's
  rewrite-or-insert path. Three shapes (rewrite existing leaf /
  insert into existing block / prepend a new block) plus the
  YAML-directive anchoring for configs starting with ``%YAML`` /
  ``---``.
* ``merge_component_yaml`` — adding a second sensor / output /
  switch must splice into the existing platform block instead of
  emitting a duplicate top-level key. A non-platform component
  (one without an ``<entity>:`` domain) falls through to plain
  append. The splice algorithm preserves trailing blank lines and
  any blocks that follow.
