"""
Tests for ``MdnsSource.probe_device``.

Adoption / wizard / on-disk YAML drops all need an eager mDNS
probe so the new device card lands fully populated (IP, version,
config_hash, api_encryption) instead of waiting on the next
periodic announcement. The probe takes the cache fast-path when
zeroconf already has the service, otherwise it spawns a fire-
and-forget resolve task.
