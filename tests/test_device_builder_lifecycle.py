"""End-to-end smoke test for ``DeviceBuilder`` start / stop.

Catches controller-wiring regressions that the per-controller
test files miss: a new controller added to ``__init__`` but not
to ``start()``'s init list, or omitted from the
``collect_api_commands`` loop, would silently lose its api
commands without breaking any narrower test.

These tests instantiate a real ``DeviceBuilder`` against a
``tmp_path`` config dir and run ``start`` + ``stop``. The three
network-touching surfaces (firmware's ``_verify_esphome_importable``
subprocess, devices' state-monitor zeroconf browser, MQTT
coordinator's broker connect) are patched out so the test stays
hermetic; everything else runs end-to-end including catalog
loads and the command-handler registration walk.
