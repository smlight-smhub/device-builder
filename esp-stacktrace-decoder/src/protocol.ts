// Message contract between the Device Builder dashboard (the embedder, on any
// http/https origin) and this decoder page (a fixed origin on GitHub Pages).
// The embedder origin is unknown, so authentication is the one-time nonce plus
// an "is this my parent" source check, never an origin allowlist. This mirrors
// flasher/src/protocol.ts; read that file's header for the reasoning, which
// applies here unchanged.
//
// The difference from the flasher: this page is embedded in a hidden iframe,
// not opened in a tab. A decode needs neither a user gesture nor a secure
// context, and a crash region arrives mid-log-stream, so a tab per region would
// be unusable. That makes `window.parent` the peer here where the flasher uses
// `window.opener`.
//
// URL hash params: 'nonce' (required) and 'origin' (optional). The nonce is a
// ONE-WAY embedder->decoder token: inbound requests must carry it, but NO
// outbound frame (ready/result/error) ever echoes it, so the pre-handoff 'ready'
// broadcast to '*' leaks no secret. The embedder correlates outbound frames by
// window source, not by nonce. 'origin' pins the outbound targetOrigin from
// frame zero (otherwise it is learned from the first inbound frame). The decoder
// re-sends 'ready' until the first request so a late embedder listener cannot
// wedge the handshake.
//
// EXTENDING THE PROTOCOL: keep changes additive, exactly as the flasher does.
// New optional fields and new message types stay forward- and backward-
// compatible because every receiver reads only the fields it knows and ignores
// unknown message types, and senders default absent fields. Both sides exchange
// PROTOCOL_VERSION (ReadyMessage.version from the decoder, RequestMessage.version
// from the embedder); a peer seeing a higher version than it speaks should
// proceed with its known subset. Bump PROTOCOL_VERSION only for a BREAKING
// change, and branch on the peer's version at that point.
