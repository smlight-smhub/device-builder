"""
Materialise a remote-build artifact tarball into the offloader's local build dir.

After :func:`materialise_remote_artifacts` returns, the offloader's
filesystem looks as if a local compile produced the build:
``<data_dir>/build/<name>/`` carries the per-platform build tree,
``<data_dir>/storage/<basename>.json`` is the rewritten StorageJSON
sidecar, ``<data_dir>/idedata/<name>.json`` is the rewritten idedata
cache (touched so ``_load_idedata``'s mtime gate hits), and -- when
the receiver-side esphome shipped one -- ``<basename>.validated.yaml``
sits next to the JSON sidecar so the next local ``esphome upload`` /
``esphome logs`` skips ``read_config()`` via esphome's fast path.
