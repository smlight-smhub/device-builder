"""
Pick the build path for a firmware job — local or one of the paired remotes.

Pure decision function: takes a snapshot of the offloader's
pairings + per-pairing connection state + queue snapshots and
returns a typed :class:`BuildPathDecision` telling the caller
whether to spawn a local ``FirmwareJob`` or dispatch to a paired
receiver. No controller refs, no I/O — the
``firmware/install`` WS handler gathers the state and threads
it in. :func:`pick_build_path` itself documents the eligibility
filter + two-tier idle / busy pick.
