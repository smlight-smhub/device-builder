"""
Locate + collect a build's flash artifacts on the dashboard's filesystem.

Wraps ESPHome's per-build manifest (``idedata.json``) into a
typed accessor that surfaces just the "files to flash" view
the dashboard needs. Used by the remote-build receiver-side
download path to pack the artifacts into a tarball, and by
future install-related flows that need to enumerate the same
set without re-running platformio.

Background:

ESPHome's compile pipeline writes two per-build records the
dashboard can read after the fact, both anchored on the
``CORE.data_dir`` deployment-mode logic (default mode at
``<config_dir>/.esphome/`` /  HA-addon mode at ``/data/`` /
``ESPHOME_DATA_DIR`` env override):

* ``<data_dir>/storage/<config>.json`` —
  :class:`esphome.storage_json.StorageJSON` sidecar with
  ``build_path`` + ``firmware_bin_path`` + framework /
  loaded-integrations metadata. Loaded via
  :func:`esphome.storage_json.ext_storage_path` +
  ``StorageJSON.load``.
* ``<data_dir>/idedata/<name>.json`` —
  :class:`esphome.platformio_api.IDEData` cache with the
  per-image flash offsets (``extra.flash_images``). esphome
  writes this on first compile + on every platformio.ini
  mtime bump.

The flash images that matter (platform-variation table):

* **ESP32**: ``bootloader.bin`` +
  ``partitions.bin`` + ``ota_data_initial.bin`` +
  ``firmware.bin`` (4 images at known offsets).
* **ESP8266**: just ``firmware.bin`` (eboot integrated).
* **Libretiny / RP2040**: ``firmware.bin`` (mass-storage
  install uses ``.uf2`` directly; out of scope here).
* **Native ESP-IDF**: similar to ESP32 with different
  paths inside ``build/`` rather than ``.pioenvs/``.

``idedata.extra_flash_images`` handles all of those —
platform-specific code lives upstream, we just consume the
manifest. ``StorageJSON.firmware_bin_path`` carries the
canonical "firmware image" path which is the same value
``idedata.firmware_bin_path`` reports.

    Raises :class:`ValueError` when ``idedata.json`` parses
