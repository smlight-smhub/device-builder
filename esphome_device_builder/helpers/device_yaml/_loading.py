    Build a Device model from a YAML config file and its StorageJSON.

    User-editable fields (name / friendly_name / comment) come from the
    YAML when present so the dashboard reflects edits immediately,
    without having to wait for the next compile to refresh StorageJSON.

    *ip* is the last-known resolved address from the device-builder
    metadata sidecar. Loading it back on startup lets the OTA address
    cache hand the CLI a usable IP before the first ping/mDNS sweep.

    *expected_config_hash* is the YAML's last-compiled config hash,
    typically read back from the metadata sidecar. Pair with the
    deployed hash from mDNS to tell "device runs the latest compile"
    apart from "device has older firmware"; empty when the device
    hasn't been compiled yet, in which case ``has_pending_changes``
    falls back to the mtime check.

    *mac_address* is the canonical ``XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX`` MAC
    observed in the device's mDNS ``mac`` TXT (normalized at
    ingest), persisted to the sidecar so the drawer / table
    render the address immediately on startup — ESPHome devices
    stay mDNS-silent until probed, and the sidecar bridges the gap
    until the discovery sweep prompts a fresh announcement.

    *build_size_bytes* is the cached total size of the per-device
    ``.esphome/build/<name>/`` tree at the freshness pair
    (build-dir mtime + ``build_info.json`` mtime) captured by the
    last walk. Threaded through the scanner so the drawer / table
    render the size immediately on startup; recomputation is
    driven by :class:`BuildSizeRefresher` (the single-worker
    refresh queue) gated on the freshness-pair equality check, so
    a steady-state re-scan stays off the heavy I/O path.

    *labels* is the per-device list of label IDs (opaque
    ``uuid.uuid4().hex`` references into the global ``_labels``
    catalog at ``.device-builder.json``). The metadata round-trip
    is the source of truth, so a reload triggered by an unrelated
    YAML edit picks up label changes the same way it picks up
    board-id edits.

    *previous* is the prior in-memory Device for this path, when one
    exists. Its ``runtime_state`` carries forward whole so a reload
    doesn't wipe what mDNS / ping has already discovered.
