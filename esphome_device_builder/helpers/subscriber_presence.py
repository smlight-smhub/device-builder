"""
Reference-counted "is anyone watching?" gate.

A small primitive consumers (the ICMP ping loop, periodic mDNS
refresh, MQTT discover-publish cadence) use to pause idle-time
traffic while no dashboard client is subscribed. The
``subscribe_events`` stream wraps its main body in
:meth:`SubscriberPresence.subscriber` so the count tracks the live
WS clients exactly; the 0→1 transition wakes every awaiter on
:meth:`wait_for_subscriber` so first-load latency is bounded by the
consumer's own loop cost, not its configured idle interval.

Lives in its own module rather than on :class:`EventBus` because
the two concerns are independent — the bus is about delivering
events to listeners, presence is about lifecycle of the dashboard
WS clients. Splitting it lets other consumers gate on presence
without taking a dependency on the bus, and keeps each class's
responsibilities single-purpose.
