"""
Publish the dashboard's own ``_esphomebuilder._tcp.local.`` service.

Part of the remote-build offload feature (issue #106). Dashboards
that browse this service type can list every other dashboard reachable
on the LAN — used by the eventual "Remote build" settings page on the
offloader and by the ESPHome Desktop welcome screen's "we found a
dashboard, want to connect?" detection.

The service-type label is ``_esphomebuilder`` rather than the
``_esphomedashboard`` named in the original design proposal: RFC
6335 §5.1 caps the label at 15 characters, ``esphomedashboard`` is
16, and ``esphomebuilder`` (14) is the closest project-identifying
alternative that fits. Parallels the existing ``_esphomelib._tcp.local.``
device service type so a packet capture shows both ESPHome surfaces
in the same ``_esphome*`` namespace.

The TXT record carries the fields a peer can't derive from the
browse response on its own:

* ``server_version`` — this dashboard's own package version, so a
  peer can flag a release-skew warning before pairing.
* ``esphome_version`` — the ``esphome`` library version this
  dashboard would compile against, so the version-mismatch warning
  can fire on the listing page rather than waiting for an upload
  to come back with a surprise build.
* ``pin_sha256`` (optional) — SHA-256 of the receiver's X25519
  peer-link public key (lowercase hex). Peers cross-check the
  responder static key observed during the Noise XX handshake
  against this TXT entry; the fingerprint is also what pairing
  pins out-of-band. Omitted when the identity helper hasn't run
  yet.
* ``remote_build_port`` (optional) — the plain-TCP port the
  receiver's peer-link Noise WS listener is bound to. Carried in
  TXT so paired peers connect to the right port even when the
  operator has overridden ``--remote-build-port``. Omitted when
  the receiver site isn't bound (default-off mode).
* ``friendly_name`` (optional) — the human machine label (e.g.
  ``MacBook-Pro``), since the instance name / SRV target are
  opaque per-install identifiers (``esphome-builder-<id>``).

The host's mDNS name is *not* in TXT — it's already on the wire.
python-zeroconf exposes the SRV record's target directly on the
resolved ``ServiceInfo``; duplicating it in TXT just bloats the packet.

The advertise reuses the existing ``AsyncEsphomeZeroconf`` instance
owned by :class:`~esphome_device_builder.controllers._device_state_monitor.DeviceStateMonitor`
so the dashboard ships one mDNS responder per process. When that
zeroconf failed to start (e.g. the port is held by avahi /
``mDNSResponder`` and we couldn't bind), the advertise is a no-op
rather than a hard failure — device discovery is the load-bearing
mDNS feature; the dashboard advertise is a nice-to-have.

    Return the IPv4 / IPv6 addresses to advertise.

    Enumerates every adapter via :mod:`ifaddr` (already a
    python-zeroconf dependency) and returns the bare addresses as
    plain strings suitable for :class:`~zeroconf.ServiceInfo`'s
    ``parsed_addresses`` keyword. Drops four classes of addresses
    that would land on the wire but never help a peer:

    * **Loopback interfaces.** Filtering by interface (``lo`` /
      ``lo0``) catches macOS's ``fe80::1``-on-``lo0`` link-local
      that wouldn't be caught by an ``ip.is_loopback`` check alone.
    * **Loopback IPs on non-loopback interfaces.** Defense in depth
      for hosts where the OS aliases ``127.0.0.1`` onto a real
      interface for some reason.
    * **Link-local addresses** — both IPv6 (``fe80::/10``) and
      IPv4 (``169.254.0.0/16``). IPv6 link-local is useless once
      the scope_id is dropped (which the mDNS wire format
      requires) — a peer receiving a bare ``fe80::xxx`` has no way
      to know which interface to send the packet out on. IPv4
      link-local (APIPA) only appears when DHCP has failed; a
      dashboard advertising itself on ``169.254.x.x`` would just
      attract pairings that immediately break the next time DHCP
      comes back. Hosts with many virtual interfaces (VPN, awdl,
      utun*) can carry a dozen link-local addresses that just
      inflate the announcement without adding reachability.
    * **Virtualisation / container bridges** — ``docker*``,
      ``veth*``, ``cni*``, ``virbr*``, ``vEthernet*`` prefixes
      plus Docker's ``br-<12 hex>`` user-defined networks (real
      LAN bridges like ``br-lan`` keep their IP). Host-namespace-
      scoped; advertising ``172.17.0.1`` from ``docker0`` points
      peers with the same default Docker subnet at their own
      bridge gateway. See ``_VIRTUAL_BRIDGE_PREFIXES`` +
      ``_DOCKER_USER_BRIDGE_RE``.

    Setting ``parsed_addresses`` explicitly is what fixes the
    "127.0.0.1 / ::1 / fe80::1 only" advertise we saw on macOS:
    when ``ServiceInfo`` is constructed with no addresses, peers
    fall back to A/AAAA lookups against the SRV target. On macOS
    that lookup is answered by ``mDNSResponder``, which can drop
    to loopback while the system's network state is in flux.
    Publishing the addresses ourselves takes that path out of the
    loop.

    .. note::

       :func:`ifaddr.get_adapters` does blocking I/O — reads
       ``/proc/net`` on Linux, calls ``GetAdaptersAddresses`` on
       Windows. Async callers must run this via
       :meth:`asyncio.AbstractEventLoop.run_in_executor` rather
       than calling it directly on the event loop. The
       :class:`DashboardAdvertiser`'s :meth:`~DashboardAdvertiser.register`
       method handles that for production use; tests that call this
       function synchronously off the loop don't need to.
