"""
Build a self-contained ESPHome bundle from a YAML on disk.

Wraps the ``esphome bundle <yaml> -o <tarball>`` CLI for the
offloader-side ``submit_job`` flow: the remote runner hands a
YAML path, this module returns the gzipped-tar bytes ready
for chunking onto the peer-link, streaming the subprocess
output to an optional per-line callback.

Subprocess rather than in-process
:class:`esphome.bundle.ConfigBundleCreator` so the bundle
build:

* Doesn't depend on ESPHome's in-process API surface (which
  evolves between releases — calling :func:`esphome.config.read_config`
  + ``ConfigBundleCreator`` directly couples us to the
  ``CORE`` global and the validation pipeline). The CLI's
  ``bundle`` subcommand is part of the user-facing contract
  and shifts much less.
* Doesn't race the dashboard's own ``CORE.config_path`` —
  every other controller path leans on ``CORE.config_path``
  being set to the dashboard sentinel; mutating it in-process
  would force a lock + save / restore dance and still leave
  a window where a concurrent ``ext_storage_path`` reader
  sees the wrong layout.
* Matches the existing pattern the firmware controller uses
  for every compile / upload (subprocess, same
  :func:`_find_esphome_cmd` resolver), so a future ESPHome
  bump only has to be validated against one integration
  surface.

Errors:

* :class:`FileNotFoundError` from missing YAML — propagated;
  the caller fails the job as configuration-not-found.
* :class:`BundleBuildError` — esphome bundle exited non-zero
  (typically schema-invalid YAML, missing include, malformed
  secret) or timed out; :attr:`BundleBuildError.output`
  carries the captured stdout/stderr unless streamed.
* :class:`OSError` from the spawn itself (e.g. ``esphome``
  not on PATH) propagates.
