r"""
Relocate Windows build data to one short, space-free root (dodges MAX_PATH + spaces).

Native Windows ESP-IDF builds fail two ways from a normal config path: the 260-char ``MAX_PATH``
limit on the deep build tree and toolchain install (the native ESP-IDF toolchain nests ~209 chars
below its install dir), and spaces in the path (common: ``C:\Users\First Last\...``) — ESP-IDF
refuses spaced install paths, and pioarduino has its own whitespace guard / gcc
``-fdebug-prefix-map`` truncation.

:func:`windows_short_build_paths` points the build tree at ``C:\esphb\<id8>`` for the ``with``
block by setting ``ESPHOME_DATA_DIR`` = that root, ``PLATFORMIO_CORE_DIR`` = ``<root>\pio`` and
``ESPHOME_ESP_IDF_PREFIX`` = ``<root>\idf`` in the process env (so ``CORE.data_dir`` and every
compile subprocess resolve there, whichever toolchain the config selects). Per-dashboard
roots nest under one ``C:\esphb`` parent rather than scattering ``C:\esphb-*`` across the drive
root. Existing data is moved in once (best-effort) so warm caches survive: from the legacy flat
``C:\esphb-<id8>`` of the first relocation release, else from ``<config>/.esphome``,
``~/.platformio`` and esphome's machine-global IDF cache. Sweeping the IDF cache in trades
upstream's all-projects sharing for the space-free guarantee: the multi-GB install becomes
per-dashboard, and a cache later repopulated by CLI use is not re-merged (the completion marker
short-circuits). Real dirs (no junction), so CMake's REALPATH can't reintroduce the spaced/long
path. The tree is left on uninstall (a reinstall keeps the warm toolchain); delete ``C:\esphb`` by
hand to reclaim space. No-op off Windows (including a Linux Docker container on Windows -- the
gate is ``os.name == "nt"``), and skipped if the user already set ``ESPHOME_DATA_DIR`` (a
deliberate path choice we don't override).
