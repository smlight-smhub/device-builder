"""
Out-of-process Native API device-info fetch.

Run as ``python -m esphome_device_builder.helpers.api_device_info``: reads
one JSON request from stdin, connects to the device over the ESPHome Native
API, and writes its name + MAC address + ESPHome version as JSON to stdout.
Running ``aioesphomeapi`` in a short-lived child keeps the heavy client out
of the long-running dashboard process. Any failure exits non-zero with no
stdout.
