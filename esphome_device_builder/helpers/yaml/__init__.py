# Prefer the libyaml-backed C loader when PyYAML was built against
# libyaml. On the M5 MacBook Pro, parsing the full board catalog
# (492 manifests) drops from 1.6s to 210ms — a ~7-8x speedup that
# directly cuts dashboard startup wall-time. Mirrors ESPHome's own
# ``yaml_util.FastestAvailableSafeLoader`` so a future audit
# against upstream lands on the same name. PyYAML wheels ship the
# C extension on every platform we target; the SafeLoader fallback
# is for the rare source install against a libyaml-less build.
#
# We deliberately do NOT replicate the upstream ``parse_yaml``
# C-then-pure-Python retry-on-YAMLError pattern. ESPHome surfaces
# the parse error to the user's terminal and uses the pure-Python
# loader's readable error message; every device-builder load site
# either swallows ``yaml.YAMLError`` (mqtt block, secrets file)
# or catches it inside the outer ``except Exception`` of the
# board-catalog walk where the manifest is our own internal data
# linted by ``script/validate_definitions.py``. A double parse
# would cost us per-error wall-time with no user-visible benefit.
