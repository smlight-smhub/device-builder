"""
Shared ``secrets.yaml`` read / merge / write helpers.

One home for every ``secrets.yaml`` touch so the bundle-import merge,
the Wi-Fi writer (the create wizard and the kebab "Set up Wi-Fi"
action), and the placeholder-state detection don't drift apart. Wi-Fi
credentials are collected per-device in the create wizard, which writes
them here so generated YAML can reference ``!secret wifi_ssid`` instead
of inlining bare credentials.

Two mutation shapes live here on purpose:
``_replace_or_append_secret`` / ``write_wifi_secrets`` *set* specific
keys (line-based, preserving inline comments), while
``merge_secrets_file`` *unions in* a whole incoming mapping keeping
existing values on conflict (ruamel round-trip).
