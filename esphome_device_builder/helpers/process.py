Subprocess teardown helpers — platform-aware kill + grace-period orchestration.

The dashboard spawns subprocesses in a few different shapes:

* **Compile / upload / install jobs** spawn ``esphome``, which forks
  PlatformIO, which forks ``gcc`` / ``esptool`` / ``mklittlefs``. The
  whole tree has to come down on cancel.
* **YAML validator session** (``editor.py``) spawns a single
  ``esphome vscode`` subprocess. Single process, no fork chain.
* **Device log streams** (``devices/controller.py``) spawn ``esphome
  logs`` for live tailing. Single process.
* **Startup probes** (``firmware/helpers._verify_esphome_importable``)
  spawn ``esphome --version`` with a hard timeout.

Three patterns end up open-coded in the call sites without this
module:

* ``with suppress(ProcessLookupError): proc.kill()`` for the race
  where the child exits between the ``returncode is None`` check and
  the kill — this is ``kill_quietly`` here.
* ``os.killpg(os.getpgid(pid), sig)`` with ``ProcessLookupError`` /
  ``PermissionError`` handling — POSIX subtree signal, exposed as
  ``_signal_process_group``.
* Windows ``taskkill /F /T`` with timeout + retcode handling —
  exposed as ``_terminate_subtree_windows``.

The orchestration helper ``terminate_subtree_with_grace`` ties those
together: SIGTERM the group → wait the grace window → SIGKILL the
group on POSIX; ``taskkill`` with a single-shot kill fallback on
Windows. That's the shape ``FirmwareController._terminate_job_process``
needs.

POSIX vs Windows asymmetry is deliberate: the POSIX path has a
graceful SIGTERM stage because well-behaved tools (``esptool``,
``platformio``) honour it and clean up serial ports / partial
writes. The Windows compile chain ignores ``CTRL_BREAK_EVENT`` and
``WM_CLOSE`` — there's no point sending a polite signal nobody's
listening for, so we go straight to ``taskkill``.

    Send *sig* to the process group of *pid*; return True iff delivered.

    Used to take down the whole esphome → platformio → gcc tree when
    the user hits Stop. ``proc.terminate()`` / ``proc.kill()`` only
    signal the direct child (the python esphome process), so the
    compiler grandchildren keep running and the build effectively
    ignores the cancel. Pair this with ``start_new_session=True`` at
    the spawn site: that makes the spawned process the leader of a
    new session (and a new process group), and its descendants
    inherit that group. The dashboard process itself is *not* in the
    same group — ``killpg(getpgid(spawned_pid), sig)`` therefore
    targets the build subtree without touching us.

    POSIX-only — ``os.getpgid`` / ``os.killpg`` don't exist on Windows.
    The Windows path goes through ``_terminate_subtree_windows`` instead.

    * ``ProcessLookupError`` — the process already exited; nothing to do.
