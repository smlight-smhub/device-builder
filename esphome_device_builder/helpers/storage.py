"""
Per-file debounced JSON store, modelled on Home Assistant's ``Store``.

Each :class:`Store` owns one JSON file end to end — read,
atomic write, debounced save, shutdown flush — and the typed
value lives in the consumer's RAM. The atomic write is a
``write-tmp + os.replace`` dance via
:func:`helpers.atomic_io.atomic_write`.

Per-file rather than wrapping a sub-key of a shared sidecar so
domain writes don't take each other out on a corrupt write,
backup / restore is per concern, and there's no lock contention
between unrelated writers.

Consumers inject *encoder* / *decoder* so this layer stays
agnostic about the wire format. mashumaro dataclasses pair with
``encoder=lambda v: orjson.dumps(v.to_dict())`` /
``decoder=lambda b: SomeClass.from_dict(orjson.loads(b))``.

Behaviour kept from HA:

* **Debounce + extend semantics.** Calls during an open delay
  window update the *latest* deadline rather than firing
  immediately; the timer reschedules itself to the latest
  requested write time when it wakes early.
* **Captured data_func at write time.** The caller hands a
  zero-arg callable producing the current value; we call it
  inside the write critical section, so a mutation between
  ``async_delay_save`` and the flush picks up the latest
  in-RAM state.
* **Mandatory shutdown registration.** The constructor takes a
  *shutdown_register* callback invoked once with
  :meth:`async_save_now`; the caller's lifecycle layer holds
  the resulting list and ``await``s every callback during
  graceful stop. Required (not optional) so a store can't be
  instantiated without telling someone who will flush it.
  ``SIGKILL`` / process crash skip the registry, same as HA's
  ``EVENT_HOMEASSISTANT_FINAL_WRITE``; pending in-RAM
  mutations are lost.

Typical use::

    import orjson

    self._store: Store[OffloaderRemoteBuildSettings] = Store(
        config_dir / "_offloader_remote_build.json",
        encoder=lambda v: orjson.dumps(v.to_dict()),
        decoder=lambda b: OffloaderRemoteBuildSettings.from_dict(orjson.loads(b)),
        shutdown_register=self._shutdown_callbacks.append,
    )
    # On every mutation:
    self._store.async_delay_save(self._serialize_pairings, delay=1.0)
