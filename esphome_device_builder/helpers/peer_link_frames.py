"""
Wire-frame shape validation shared between peer-link sender / receiver paths.

Defensive runtime check on a peer-controlled dict — Noise AEAD
guarantees the bytes haven't been tampered with in flight, but
the JSON inside is whatever the peer chose to encode and may
not match the TypedDict contract. Indexing missing or
wrong-typed fields would otherwise raise inside the dispatch
hot path and unwind out of the receive loop without an ack /
without firing the corresponding bus event.

The check lives in :mod:`helpers` rather than on either side's
controller so the receiver-side accept handlers
(:mod:`controllers.remote_build.submit_job`) and the
offloader-side receive loop
(:mod:`controllers.remote_build.peer_link_client`) share one
implementation. Built on :mod:`voluptuous` (already in the
dependency closure via ESPHome) so per-frame schemas compose
the same way every other input-validation surface in the
project does (see :mod:`helpers.voluptuous_validators` for
the shared chain elements).

      ``reason`` on ``submit_job_ack`` / ``artifacts_end``
      don't trip the schema — callers check those
      individually after the required gate).
    * Wraps every ``int`` type with :func:`not_bool` so a
      stray ``True`` / ``False`` doesn't slip past as a
      valid integer (Python's ``isinstance(True, int)`` is
      true).

      we want strict type matches without silent
      type-coercion, so plain type-as-validator (which
      voluptuous treats as ``isinstance``) is right.

    per-frame cost stays at one schema call.
