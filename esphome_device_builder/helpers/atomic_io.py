"""
Atomic filesystem writes for dashboard-internal artefacts.

For cert / key / token / metadata-sidecar files, plus the
mode-preserving rewrite of user-editable YAML.

Why not the upstream helper here: ``write_file``'s ``private``
flag is binary (0o644 vs 0o600), and we need arbitrary modes for
caller-controlled-mode shapes (cert / key + future token stores)
and for keeping an operator-set mode across a rewrite.

Blocking I/O — call from ``run_in_executor``, not the loop.
