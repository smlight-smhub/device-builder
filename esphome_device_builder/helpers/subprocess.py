"""Subprocess helpers.

Centralises ``asyncio.create_subprocess_exec`` so every spawn forces
``close_fds=False``. Python <3.14's default (``close_fds=True``) makes
the subprocess module ``fork()`` the parent and have the child iterate
``/proc/self/fd`` to close descriptors before ``exec()``; on
memory-pressured systems that copies a non-trivial amount of page
tables for nothing. None of our spawns rely on inherited descriptors
being closed at the boundary, and the upstream esphome dashboard uses
the same pattern in ``esphome.dashboard.util.subprocess``.

    opened as a pipe only then). *merge_stderr* (default) redirects
    stderr onto stdout for a unified stream; pass ``False`` to discard

    JSON payload). *on_line*, when given, streams each output chunk
    (split via :func:`iter_lines_with_progress`, terminators kept) to
    the callback as it arrives instead of capturing — ``stdout`` on the
    result is then empty; the callback owns retention.

    inspects ``timed_out`` rather than handling a raised
    exception, which keeps the common shape "one return, check
    flags" instead of try/except at every call site.

    ``kill_quietly`` fires SIGKILL and the :class:`CancelledError`
    re-raises immediately. The dead subprocess is reaped by asyncio's
    child watcher in the background — we deliberately don't
    ``await proc.wait()`` here because that would either swallow
    the second cancellation (violating
    ``feedback_no_suppress_cancelled_error``) or stall the
    propagation. SIGKILL'd processes exit within microseconds

    ``StreamReader``'s default ``async for`` iteration only splits
    on ``\n``, which buffers carriage-return-based progress
    output (esptool's ``Writing at 0x... (5%)\r``, PlatformIO's
    progress bars) until the next newline arrives — typically only
    when the operation finishes, so the user sees a long pause and
    then a wall of progress lines instead of a live indicator.

    ``\r\n`` is treated as a *single* logical terminator (one
    chunk ending in ``\r\n``) rather than two — the alternative
    would emit a spurious empty event for every CRLF line on
    Windows where Python's stdout text-mode write translates
    ``\n`` into ``\r\n``.

    Each emitted chunk **keeps its trailing terminator** so the
    consumer can decide whether to append a new line or overwrite
    the last one (frontend ansi-log component leans on the
    distinction). Decoding is utf-8 with ``errors="replace"`` so a
    stray byte sequence doesn't kill the stream. Buffer is flushed
    on EOF so a final chunk without a terminator still surfaces.
