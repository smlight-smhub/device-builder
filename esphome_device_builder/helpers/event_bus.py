      one-shot must-land events like terminal job results or
      lifecycle status transitions, where a silent drop would
      leave the UI stuck on stale state forever.

    Stream bus events to *client* via a bounded asyncio.Queue.

    Solves three correctness properties every WS-streaming command
    needs to get right, in one place:

    1. **Snapshot+subscribe atomicity.** Listeners attach inside
       ``bus.listening`` *before* ``send_initial`` is awaited, so
       any event fired during the initial replay queues through the
       listener and lands strictly after the initial payload — no
       silent loss between snapshot and live, no duplication.
    2. **Bounded memory.** A single bounded ``asyncio.Queue``
       (default 4000 slots) prevents a slow follower from
       accumulating every fired event in memory until disconnect.
    3. **Cleanup on cancel.** When the WS task is cancelled
       (client disconnect), the ``with`` block exits and
       ``bus.listening``'s ``finally`` releases every listener.
       No closures keep the closed client alive.

    Callers wire the bus → client mapping via two callbacks:

    - ``handle_event(event, controls)`` runs synchronously inside
      ``bus.fire`` (no awaits). It decides what — if anything — to
      enqueue for *event*, picking ``controls.push`` for normal
      events and ``controls.push_priority`` / ``controls.end`` for
      events that must land (e.g. terminal results, sentinels).
    - ``send_initial(controls)`` is awaited inside the listening
      block before draining. It can ``await client.send_event(...)``
      to seed the client and may call ``controls.end()`` to stop
      the drain immediately (e.g. terminal job: replay history then
      exit, no live drain needed).

    The drain loop runs until the sentinel ``None`` is received
    (cooperative shutdown via ``controls.end()``) or the surrounding
    task is cancelled.
