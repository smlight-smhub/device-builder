"""Internal subprocess helpers that need ``esphome.components`` imported.

Run as ``device-builder-helper <command>`` (the package's ``[project.scripts]``
entry point) or ``python -m esphome_device_builder.helper_cli``. The dashboard
spawns this so its long-lived process never imports heavy ``esphome.components``
modules (esp32 pulls espidf -> requests -> esphome.config); the child does the
import, prints JSON to stdout, and exits.

Commands:
  download-types <storage-json-path> <component>
      Print ``[{title, description, file}]`` from
      ``esphome.components.<component>.get_download_types`` for the device whose
      StorageJSON sidecar is at the given path. Used for the build-dir-dependent
      platforms (libretiny / nrf52) the generated catalog can't precompute.

  decode-backtrace
      Read ``{config_path, storage_path, idedata_path, lines}`` as JSON on stdin
      and print ``{decoded: [{index, text}], unavailable_reason, detail}``,
      where ``detail`` is free text for the parent's log. Feeds the
      lines through ``esphome.components.<platform>.process_stacktrace`` so a
      crash captured over Web Serial (no inline decoder) gets the same addr2line
      output ``esphome logs`` produces. Request rides stdin rather than argv:
      log lines are untrusted and unbounded, and argv is both size-capped and
      world-readable in the process table.
