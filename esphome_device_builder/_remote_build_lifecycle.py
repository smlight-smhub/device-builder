        Bind the peer-link Noise WS listener if remote-build is enabled.

        Default-on for non-HA-addon deployments: a fresh sidecar
        deserialises to ``RemoteBuildSettings(enabled=True)`` and
        the listener binds without an extra operator step. The
        receiver-side **pair-approval dialog** is the privilege
        gate — an unpaired peer can connect to the TCP port but
        the Noise XX handshake fails without a matching pubkey, so
        binding the port grants nothing on its own. Loads the
        X25519 peer-link identity through
        :attr:`DeviceBuilder.peer_link_identity_store` — the sole
        cryptographic identity used by this listener; the store
        caches the identity so repeated binds don't re-read the
        keypair file.

        **HA addon: default-off but operator-overridable.** The
        addon's docker container doesn't expose port 6055 to the
        LAN by default, and the mDNS advertise is already skipped
        on HA addon — so binding by default would produce a port
        that's invisible to LAN peers. But some legacy-dashboard
        users DID expose port 6052 (and historically other addon
        ports) via the addon's ``ports:`` config, so a hard skip
        would lock them out. The compromise: on HA addon, skip
        the bind unless the operator has *explicitly persisted*
        ``_remote_build`` in metadata via the Settings toggle.
        ``has_remote_build_settings_persisted`` returns ``True``
        the moment ``set_settings`` writes the block — even a
        write that lands on the dataclass defaults still flips
        the signal. This means: fresh addon install → no bind;
        addon operator flips the toggle in Settings → bind
        respects the persisted ``enabled`` field. The HA-addon
        operator path stays open; the fresh-install default
        stops burning a port nothing can reach.

        Fail-soft: any exception during identity load or bind is
        caught and logged. The main dashboard keeps running; the
        operator gets a warning and the listener is simply absent
        until the next restart with the issue resolved.
