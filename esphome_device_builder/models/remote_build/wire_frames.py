      receivers omit it → ``""``). ``"provision"`` means this
      ``failed`` terminal was because the receiver couldn't provision

      is an ordinary failure the offloader surfaces as-is.

    bugs in our own framing — the per-frame Noise AEAD already
    covers wire-level confidentiality + authentication, so the
    hash isn't a security check.

    ``firmware.bin`` (e.g. ``"0x10000"`` on ESP32, ``"0x0"`` on
    ESP8266 / libretiny / RP2040), resolved receiver-side

    flash-image offsets ride inside ``idedata.json`` in the
