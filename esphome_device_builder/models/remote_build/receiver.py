    LAN-discoverable + pairable without an extra operator step
    — binding the port grants no privilege by itself; pair-
    approval is what authorises a peer. **HA-addon deployments
    override this default at the bind site**: a fresh addon
    install with no persisted ``_remote_build`` block does not
    bind, since the addon container doesn't expose port 6055 by
    default. Operators who add ``6055/tcp`` to the addon's
    ``ports:`` flip the toggle in Settings; the persisted block
    then carries explicit opt-in and subsequent boots respect
    ``enabled`` like every other mode. See
