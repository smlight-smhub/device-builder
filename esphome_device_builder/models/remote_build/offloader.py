class StoredPairing(DashboardModel):
    """
    Offloader-side record of a paired (or pending) receiver.

    Persisted in a per-file ``Store`` at
    ``<config_dir>/.offloader_pairings.json``; RAM-first model
    (the controller's ``_pairings`` dict is the source of truth,
    debounced to disk).

    Keys on ``(receiver_hostname, receiver_port)`` because
    that's what the user enters in the Pair dialog and what
    reconnection needs — *not* the receiver-side ``StoredPeer``
    key (which is the offloader's ``dashboard_id``). The two
    shapes are deliberately not the same row passed both ways.

    ``static_x25519_pub`` is the canonical identifier the Noise
    handshake binds to; ``pin_sha256`` is its lowercase-hex
    SHA-256 (the OOB-verified pin). Both are stored so a future
    re-pair can detect identity rotation without re-deriving on
    every connect.

    ``status`` defaults to APPROVED because the disk filter
    strips PENDING rows before write — reading a row back from
    the ``Store`` always produces APPROVED. PENDING is the
    explicit-construction case: ``request_pair`` sets it before
    adding to the dict; ``_apply_pair_status_result`` flips it
    to APPROVED in place when the receiver reports the flip.

    ``__post_init__`` runs :data:`_PAIRING_VALIDATOR` so a
    malformed sidecar row (hand-edit, partial-write recovery,
    schema-skew across upgrades) is rejected by ``from_dict``
    rather than landing as a multi-megabyte string in memory.
