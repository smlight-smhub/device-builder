        Reset per-run state so the job is ready to be re-executed.

        Called by the persistence-load path when a ``RUNNING`` job
        survives a dashboard restart and is being re-queued for a
        fresh run. Lives on the model (not as a free helper) so
        every place that adds a per-run-state field is forced to

          diagnostic history. Appends a marker line so a
          follower tailing the merged buffer can see exactly
          where the rebuild starts. (Re-routing a compile to

          instead, so it doesn't claim a restart that didn't
          happen.)

          ``error`` / ``started_at`` / ``completed_at`` /
          ``exit_code`` back to their defaults.
        - **Doesn't change ``status``** — the caller decides
          the transition (load path flips ``RUNNING`` →
          ``QUEUED``; future callers might want a different
          target).
        - **Preserves identity** — ``configuration`` /
          ``job_type`` / ``port`` / ``new_name`` / ``depends_on`` / ``created_at``
          / ``job_id`` / ``source`` / ``source_pin_sha256`` /

    Payload for the five terminal-or-lifecycle ``EventType.JOB_*`` events.

    ``EventType.JOB_QUEUED`` / ``JOB_STARTED`` / ``JOB_COMPLETED`` /
    ``JOB_FAILED`` / ``JOB_CANCELLED`` share a single shape;
    subscribers differentiate by the ``EventType`` carried
    alongside, not by inspecting the payload. The full
    ``FirmwareJob`` rides through so the frontend's job-table
    renderer has every field it needs (status, exit_code,
    progress, output) without an additional fetch.

class JobOutputData(TypedDict):
    r"""
    Payload for ``EventType.JOB_OUTPUT``.

    One event per output chunk of a running subprocess. ``job_id``
    keys the chunk to its job; ``line`` is the raw stdout/stderr
    text *with its trailing terminator preserved* — ``\n``,
    ``\r``, or ``\r\n`` (see ``iter_lines_with_progress`` for why
    the terminator rides through). Carriage-return-only chunks
    are esptool / PlatformIO progress overwrites; the frontend's
    ansi-log renderer leans on the distinction to decide whether
    to append a new line or overwrite the last one. The
    ``follow_job`` / ``stream_logs`` streams push these through
    verbatim.

class JobProgressData(TypedDict):

    Payload for ``EventType.JOB_PROGRESS``.

    Coarse 0-100 progress estimate parsed from PlatformIO /
    esptool output. The streaming ingest only fires this event
    when the parsed percent advances, so the gauge climbs
    monotonically *within a phase*. At known phase seams
    (REMOTE install's compile → upload boundary —
    :func:`controllers.firmware.remote_runner._fetch_and_run_local_upload`)
    the runner explicitly fires a ``progress=0`` reset so the
    next phase's percents don't get clamped against the
    previous phase's peak. Subscribers should render the bar
    from the latest event rather than asserting non-decreasing
    progress.
