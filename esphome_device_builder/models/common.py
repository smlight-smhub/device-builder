    Pre-filled value for a single config-entry on a featured component.

    Three modes, expressed by which fields are populated:

    - ``value`` only: pre-filled default, user can change it.
    - ``value`` + ``locked=True``: fixed value. Frontend disables the input;
      backend rejects deviating user input on add.
    - ``suggestions``: short list of allowed values (frontend renders a
      picker). ``value`` (if also set) is the initial selection.

    ``locked`` and ``suggestions`` are mutually exclusive. ``value`` can be
    a primitive, list, or dict — the latter for nested config entries.
