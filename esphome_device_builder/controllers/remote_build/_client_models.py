"""
Offloader-side peer-link client value types: errors + results + session state.

The types here describe inputs and outputs of the four
offloader-side intents the peer-link client drives —
``preview`` / ``pair_request`` / ``pair_status`` / ``peer_link``
— plus the per-session in-flight state the long-lived
:class:`PeerLinkClient` keeps alive between handshake and
close.

Public surface (every type without a leading underscore):

* :class:`PeerLinkClientError`,
  :class:`PeerLinkNoSessionError`,
  :class:`DuplicateRequestError`,
  :class:`SubmitJobTimeoutError`,
  :class:`SubmitJobSessionLostError`,
  :class:`DownloadArtifactsError` — the typed exceptions the
  WS-command layer maps onto the matching
  :class:`CommandError` shape.
* :class:`InitiatorRoundTrip` — output of the shared Noise XX
  driver :func:`drive_initiator_round_trip`.
* :class:`RequestPairResult`, :class:`PairStatusResult`,
  :class:`DownloadArtifactsResult` — outputs of the per-intent
  drivers / :class:`PeerLinkClient` methods.

Private surface (underscore-prefixed) is in-session state
held by :class:`PeerLinkClient` and never crosses the module
boundary.

    indefinitely on the bus event channel until either an admin

    removed events that wake the wait), so the round-trip can
