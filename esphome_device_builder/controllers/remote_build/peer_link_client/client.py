"""
Long-lived offloader-side peer-link Noise WS session.

:class:`PeerLinkClient` is the one-per-pairing initiator that
opens the long-lived ``intent="peer_link"`` WS, runs the Noise XX
handshake via :func:`.one_shot._drive_initiator_handshake_and_read_response`,
parks on a receive loop with an encrypted heartbeat, and reconnects
with bounded backoff on every close other than a receiver-side
``superseded``. Submit-job / cancel-job / artifact-download flows
ride the same channel; inbound frames fan out to bus events the
offloader controller and the firmware fan-out listen to.

The one-shot initiator helpers (``preview_pair`` / ``request_pair``
/ ``await_pair_status``) live in :mod:`.one_shot` — same handshake,
different lifetime shape.
