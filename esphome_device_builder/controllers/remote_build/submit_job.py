"""
Receiver-side ``submit_job`` flow for the remote-build peer-link.

Drives the post-handshake ``submit_job`` header +
``submit_job_chunk`` stream from the peer-link receive loop into
a queued :class:`FirmwareJob` carrying the offloader's
``dashboard_id`` in :attr:`FirmwareJob.remote_peer`. This module
ends at "ack the bundle and queue the job"; the lifecycle
fan-out the other direction — pushing ``job_state_changed`` /
``job_output`` frames over the submitting session — lives in
:mod:`.job_fanout`.

Flow:

1. Offloader sends a ``submit_job`` header
   (``job_id`` / ``configuration_filename`` / ``target`` /
   ``total_bundle_bytes`` / ``num_chunks`` / ``bundle_sha256``).
   The receive loop forwards it to
   :meth:`SubmitJobReceiver.handle_submit_job`.
2. We construct a :class:`BundleAssembler` against the announced
   sizes / digest and store it in ``_inflight`` keyed on the
   session's ``dashboard_id``. One concurrent submit per session.
3. Offloader streams ``submit_job_chunk`` frames; the receive
   loop forwards each to
   :meth:`SubmitJobReceiver.handle_submit_job_chunk`. We
   base64-decode and feed the assembler. On the chunk that
   carries ``is_last=True`` we finalise (validates byte count
   + sha256), write the assembled tarball to
   ``<config>/.esphome/.remote_builds/<dashboard_id>/<device_name>.tar.gz``
   (sibling of the per-device subtree, not child — see
   :class:`helpers.remote_build_layout.RemoteBuildPath` for the
   canonical layout),
   extract via :func:`esphome.bundle.prepare_bundle_for_compile`
   (which preserves ``.esphome/`` / ``.pioenvs/`` for incremental
   builds — the load-bearing reason for the stable per-peer
   per-device subtree), and queue a :class:`FirmwareJob` with
   ``remote_peer=session.dashboard_id``.
4. We send a typed :class:`SubmitJobAckFrameData` — accepted on
   success, accepted=False with a structured ``reason`` on any
   of the rejection paths. Bundle-assembler errors that signal
   wire-level misbehaviour
   (:class:`BundleAssemblerError` outside the fix-with-retry set)
   also trigger ``terminate{reason: malformed_frame}`` because
   the offloader has already wandered off the wire format and
   continuing the session would only invite more corruption.

Per-peer per-device subtree: ``<dashboard_id>/<device_name>``.
The two-segment key dedupes correctly across multi-offloader
fleets (two HA Greens both shipping a "kitchen" device land in
distinct subtrees) without colliding within one offloader's
pool. PlatformIO's incremental-compile cache then sees stable
source paths between submissions and skips the cold-rebuild
hit. Phase-6 24h TTL sweeps cold subtrees later.
