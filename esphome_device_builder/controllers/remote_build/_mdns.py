"""
mDNS TXT decoding + service-info projection for the remote-build controller.

The dashboard's ``_esphomebuilder._tcp.local.`` browse path
turns each :class:`zeroconf.asyncio.AsyncServiceInfo` from a
neighbouring dashboard into a :class:`RemoteBuildPeer` row for
the discovery list, and reads TXT values (``server_version``,
``esphome_version``, ``pin_sha256``, ``remote_build_port``)
defensively — a corrupted / missing / over-range TXT entry must
not raise into the browser callback or trigger spurious rebind
probes.

Two endpoints also compare ``(host, port)`` tuples
case-and-trailing-dot-insensitively (the dashboard's own
advertise lookup, and the mDNS-driven auto-rebind path), so
that lives here too.
