    Wire ``reason`` value on a structured ``terminate`` close frame.

    Sent inside an :attr:`AppMessageType.TERMINATE` application
    frame so the offloader's reconnect logic can branch
    on the reason rather than guessing from the WS close code.

    * ``SUPERSEDED`` — a fresh peer-link connect from the same
      ``dashboard_id`` displaces this older session. Standard
      "restarted offloader" path.
    * ``HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT`` — three pings in a row without a
      matching pong. The session loop closes itself; the wire
      frame may not actually reach the peer (TCP is presumed
      dead) but the WS close is still graceful from the
      receiver's side.
    * ``SERVER_SHUTTING_DOWN`` — the receiver controller is
      stopping. Sent to every active session before
      :meth:`ReceiverController.stop` returns.
    * ``MALFORMED_FRAME`` — a frame fails Noise decrypt /
      JSON parse / shape validation. Closes the session
      immediately; peer can reconnect after the next handshake.
