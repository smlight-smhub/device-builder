"""
Pack / unpack the receiver's build-artifact tarball.

The remote-build feature ships compiled firmware between two
dashboards by serialising the receiver's build tree into a
single gzipped tarball. This module owns the pack + unpack
helpers — pure data transforms with no WS / wire-flow
knowledge — so the two end-to-end surfaces that consume the
format (the receiver-side :class:`ArtifactsDownloadSender`
streamer and the offloader-side ``download_artifacts`` WS
unpacker / source-routed runner) call into one place instead
of re-implementing the format twice.

Tarball layout (materialise-locally wire format):

.. code-block:: text

    storage.json     # receiver's <data_dir>/storage/<basename>.json
    idedata.json     # receiver's <data_dir>/idedata/<name>.json (esphome's cache copy)
    platformio.ini   # receiver's <build_path>/platformio.ini
    build_info.json  # receiver's <build_path>/build_info.json (optional; #654)
    <per-platform build-tree files>  # see artifact_platforms/*.py

The metadata members at the top of the tarball are
platform-independent — every build ships them
(``build_info.json`` is optional: skipped when the receiver's
build tree predates ESPHome's ``build_info.json`` write
hook). The :mod:`controllers.remote_build.artifact_platforms`
registry drives which build-tree files travel alongside them;
see the per-platform modules for the exact paths each platform
ships.

The offloader-side materialiser
(:func:`helpers.remote_artifacts_materialise.materialise_remote_artifacts`)
reads ``storage.json`` + ``idedata.json``, rewrites their
receiver-absolute path fields to offloader-absolute, and stages
them at the offloader's canonical cache locations:
``<data_dir>/storage/<basename>.json`` and
``<data_dir>/idedata/<name>.json``. The build tree extracts as-is
under ``<data_dir>/build/<name>/``.

The :func:`unpack_artifacts_response` adapter is a separate
consumer — it serves the multi-image set to the browser-side
Web Serial flasher via the offloader's
``remote_build/download_artifacts`` WS command, keyed by image
basename (the frontend doesn't care about the build-tree
layout). See :func:`_rewrite_idedata_paths` for the basename
rewrite the frontend's lookup relies on.

    The receiver writes absolute build-dir paths into

    consumers look up bytes by basename in the unpacked
    ``images`` list, so the wire-rendered idedata mirrors
