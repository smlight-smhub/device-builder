    Duplicate an existing device YAML under a fresh hostname.

    Designed for the "I bought 10 of the same bulb" workflow:
    keeps the source's components and wiring intact but takes
    a fresh ``esphome.name``, a fresh ``friendly_name``, and a
    freshly-generated ``api.encryption.key`` so two siblings
    don't share encryption material. ``!secret`` /
    ``${substitution}`` indirections for the API key are
    preserved on purpose since the indirection target is
    shared with the source on disk and rewriting the
    indirection name would silently desync the rendered
