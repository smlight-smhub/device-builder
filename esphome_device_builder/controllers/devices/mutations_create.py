    Create a new device configuration.

    *file_content* writes user-supplied YAML as-is; *board_id*
    generates from the board template; neither emits a minimal
    valid esp32 stub for the wizard's "empty configuration"
    button. Generated flows validate before write
    (``INTERNAL_ERROR`` on regression); the user-upload flow
    deliberately skips validation so an existing config from
    an older ESPHome version (with since-changed schemas) can
    still land in the editor for repair. ``board_id`` is
    persisted (as a deliberate user pick) only when explicitly
    provided; otherwise the scanner derives it from the YAML on
    each resolve against the current catalog. A filename collision
    raises ``ALREADY_EXISTS`` unless *overwrite* is set, which
    replaces the YAML in place and preserves the existing device's
    metadata (labels / comment, and its board_id unless a new
    *board_id* is explicitly provided) and StorageJSON.
