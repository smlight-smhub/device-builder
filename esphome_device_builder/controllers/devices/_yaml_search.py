"""
YAML-content search loop for ``DevicesController.search_yaml``.

Lifted out of the controller so the loop body — walk devices,
read lines from the cache, line-grep, gather hits, respect the
two caps (per-file and total) — has its own home and its own
tests. The controller stays focused on locking and post-search
cache pruning; this module owns the actual search.

No blocking I/O at runtime:

- File reads happen inside ``YamlSearchCache.get_lines`` which
  already wraps ``Path.stat`` / ``Path.read_text`` in
  ``asyncio.to_thread``.
- The per-line substring scan is in-memory against an
  already-split list, so the only "work" between awaits is a
  string comparison. For configs in the small-thousands-of-lines
  range that's microseconds.
- An explicit ``await asyncio.sleep(0)`` between devices yields
  control to the event loop every iteration so a fleet of 100+
  devices doesn't monopolise the run loop while the cache is
  warm (the cache hit path doesn't do I/O so wouldn't otherwise
  yield).

    Scan a single file's pre-split line list for *needle*.

    Synchronous hot path of the search loop — pure Python work
    against an already-loaded ``list[str]``, no I/O, no awaits.
    Extracted so the benchmark suite can measure just the
    line-scan cost (the rest of ``search_yaml_devices`` is
    asyncio + cache machinery whose overhead would otherwise
    dominate the signal).

    Returns ``(matches, total)``: up to *max_take* matches, plus
    the total number of matching lines in *lines*. The scan keeps
    counting past the cap so ``total > len(matches)`` tells the
    caller the match list was truncated; counting walks every
    line, the same work a no-match needle already does, so the
    worst case is unchanged. The caller folds two upstream caps
    (``per_file_cap``, the remaining ``max_results`` budget
    across the fleet) into a single ``max_take`` value before
    calling. The ``MAX_LINES_PER_FILE`` pathological-file cap is
    also applied by the caller via a pre-slice on *lines*.

    *needle* must be pre-lowered when ``case_sensitive`` is
    ``False`` — the caller lowers it once outside the per-file
    loop so we don't re-lower the same needle for every device.

    Each match carries ``before`` / ``after`` context windows
    sliced from *lines* directly (``context_lines`` on each
    side, clamped at the file edges). The frontend renders the
    match as a code-snippet block; without context the
    surrounding ``device:`` / ``platform:`` / list-anchor key
    that gives the match its meaning is invisible.

    *context_lines* is bounded by ``MAX_CONTEXT_LINES`` at the
    controller; this function trusts the caller to have already
    clamped (it's a bare-int slice index, no further validation
    here). Pass ``0`` for an empty window if a caller ever wants
    just the matched line — the slice math degenerates cleanly.

    Returns a ``(results, live_configurations)`` tuple. The

    cache prune against ``live_configurations`` and the
    response-shape contract; this function just produces the
    list.

    Parameters:
    - ``devices`` — iterable of objects exposing ``name``,
      ``friendly_name``, ``configuration``.
    - ``cache`` — the ``YamlSearchCache`` (controller-owned)
      that memoises ``(mtime, lines)`` per file.
    - ``rel_path(configuration)`` — resolves a configuration
      filename to its on-disk ``Path``. Indirected so the
      controller's ``self._db.settings.rel_path`` doesn't leak
      into this module.
    - ``needle`` — the search string. Must be pre-lowered when
      ``case_sensitive`` is False (caller's responsibility — we
      avoid lowering it on every line).
    - ``case_sensitive`` — when False, each line is lowered
      before the substring check.
    - ``max_results`` — hard cap on total matches across the
      fleet. Walk stops once this is reached.
    - ``per_file_cap`` — per-file cap so a chatty match doesn't
      crowd out hits from other devices.
    - ``context_lines`` — number of ``before`` / ``after``
      lines included on each match. Should already be clamped
      to ``[0, MAX_CONTEXT_LINES]`` by the caller (today that's
      ``DevicesController.search_yaml`` on the WS path; future
      callers — tests, scripts, an HTTP-shim — own the clamp
      themselves). This function doesn't re-validate so a typo'd
      / hostile request can't blow the payload IF the caller
      did its job.

    ``live_configurations`` is the *full* set of input device
    configurations regardless of where the walk short-circuited
    on ``max_results``. The caller uses it to prune cache entries
    for devices that have actually disappeared; if it only
    reflected the walked subset, a capped search would
    spuriously evict warm entries for unwalked-but-still-live
    devices and the next keystroke would re-read them from disk.
