"""
Subprocess ``git`` wrapper backing the config-dir version history.

Synchronous on purpose — every method shells out to ``git`` and is
meant to be driven from an executor by
:class:`VersionHistoryController`, never from the event loop. The
wrapper is deliberately conservative about a *pre-existing* repo
(``/config/esphome`` is commonly already a git work tree, or sits
inside one such as ``/config``):

- It **adopts** an existing work tree rather than re-initialising,
  and never rewrites the user's ``.gitignore``.
- Commits are **pathspec-scoped** (``git commit -- <paths>``) so a
  partial commit never sweeps the user's unrelated staged edits into
  our history.
- It never writes ``user.*`` into the repo/global config — the commit
  identity is passed per-invocation via ``git -c user.name=...``.
- ``--no-verify`` + ``commit.gpgsign=false`` keep our automatic commits
  from tripping the user's hooks or blocking on a signing prompt.

If the ``git`` binary is absent the wrapper stays disabled and every
method is a no-op, so version history is a soft, optional feature.
