"""
Device connectivity monitor — mDNS browser + ping fallback.

Tracks online/offline state for the configured devices, with mDNS as
the primary source (event-driven) and ICMP ping as a periodic fallback
for devices that aren't broadcasting their service. MQTT observations
are also welcomed via :meth:`apply` for devices that opt into MQTT
discovery. The monitor calls back into the owning controller whenever
a state actually changes; controllers stay free of zeroconf / icmplib
/ aiomqtt details.

Source precedence (highest first): ``mdns`` > ``mqtt`` > ``ping``. A
lower-priority source can never override the state set by a higher one.
A separate Native API fallback fills ``mac_address`` / ``deployed_version``
for online API devices mDNS hasn't reached; it never drives ONLINE/OFFLINE
and so stays out of the precedence ledger. The API reviver is the one
Native API path that does drive state: it revives a stuck-offline device
from its persisted IP after identity verification, claiming under the
``ping`` source.
