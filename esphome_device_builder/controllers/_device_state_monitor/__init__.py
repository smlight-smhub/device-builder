"""Device connectivity monitor — mDNS browser + ping fallback.

Tracks online/offline state for the configured devices, with mDNS as
the primary source (event-driven) and ICMP ping as a periodic fallback
for devices that aren't broadcasting their service. MQTT observations
are also welcomed via :meth:`apply` for devices that opt into MQTT
discovery. The monitor calls back into the owning controller whenever
a state actually changes; controllers stay free of zeroconf / icmplib
/ aiomqtt details.

Source precedence (highest first): ``mdns`` > ``mqtt`` > ``ping``. A
lower-priority source can never override the state set by a higher one.
