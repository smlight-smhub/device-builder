"""
Native API fallback source for MAC address and ESPHome version.

When mDNS multicast doesn't reach the dashboard (the common Docker-bridge
case) a device can be ONLINE via ping yet have a blank ``mac_address`` /
``deployed_version`` — those fields come only from the ``_esphomelib._tcp``
TXT records. Each sweep first re-applies zeroconf-cached TXT payloads for
free (the browser handler can miss an announce whose records still landed in
the cache), level-syncs the non-API ``deployed_identity_live`` freshness flag
against the cached ``_http._tcp`` identity TXT, then connects to still-blank
devices over the Native API in a
short-lived subprocess. It only ever supplies the TXT-derived fields; it
never drives ONLINE/OFFLINE, so it stays out of the source-precedence
ledger. The one Native API path that does drive state is the last-resort
revival in ``api_reviver.py``.
