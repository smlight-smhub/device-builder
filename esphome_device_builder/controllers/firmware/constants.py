"""
Static configuration for the firmware controller.

Error-pattern regexes used to flag failures even when the
subprocess exit code is 0, history-retention pool sizes, and the
queue/cleanup tunables. Pure data — no I/O, no controller state.
Imported unchanged into ``controller.py``; tests reach for
individual constants from this module directly.

Terminal job state / event sets — needed by both the firmware
controller and external callers like ``api/legacy.py`` — live in
``models/firmware.py`` next to ``JobStatus`` (exported as
``TERMINAL_JOB_STATUSES`` / ``TERMINAL_JOB_EVENTS``) so consumers
across both layers can import them through the same public
interface.

# Progress markers we actually want to surface as job.progress. The
# original wide-open ``\d{1,3}%`` regex matched anything carrying a
# percent sign — including PlatformIO's startup "Unpacking [###] 100%"
# package-extract bar and the post-compile "RAM: 19.3%" / "Flash:
# 80.0%" memory-usage report. Both pinned the bar to non-monotonic
# garbage long before the build's actual progress signal arrived.
# Tightened to a whitelist of three known-real progress shapes:
#
#   * PlatformIO Arduino compile:    ``[ 17%] Compiling foo.cpp.o``
#     The percentage MUST start the line and live inside square
#     brackets so PIO's ESP-IDF builds (which don't emit a per-file
#     percent at all — their ninja ``[N/M]`` counter is handled
#     separately by ``_NINJA_PROGRESS_PATTERN``) and the
#     package-extract bar (no ``[NN%]`` shape) never trip it.
#   * esptool serial flash (legacy):  ``Writing at 0x10000... (45 %)``
#     We match a bare parenthesized percentage anywhere in the line:
#     ``(\s*\d{1,3}\s*%\s*\)``. In practice that is enough for the
#     older esptool output shape, and no other expected PIO/ESPHome
#     output uses parens around a bare percentage.
#   * esptool serial flash (current): ``Writing at 0x10000 [bar]  84.8% NNN/NNN bytes...``
#     Newer esptool releases dropped the parens and added an ASCII
#     progress bar plus a decimal percentage. Pinned to the
#     ``Writing at`` prefix so the wider ``\d{1,3}(?:\.\d+)?%``
#     match doesn't fire on memory-usage / unpacking / stray-percent
#     lines elsewhere in the build output. The runner sets
#     ``FORCE_COLOR=1`` / ``CLICOLOR_FORCE=1`` so esptool emits ANSI
#     escape sequences (e.g. ``\x1b[2K`` clear-line) that prefix the
#     output — DO NOT anchor with ``^\s*`` here, those escapes
#     aren't whitespace and the anchor would silently fail in
#     production while passing in plain-text tests. Capture the
#     integer part and discard the decimal — the dashboard's
#     progress bar is a single coarse 0-100 indicator.
#   * ESPHome OTA upload:            ``Uploading: [====] 100% Done...``
#     Anchored to the ``Uploading:`` prefix.
# Force ANSI colour through even when stdout isn't a TTY. The local
# subprocess path and the source-routed remote runner's local upload
# step share this — both spawn an ``esphome`` subprocess whose
# output the dashboard pipes verbatim to the firmware-tasks UI, so a
# divergence between the two would produce visually-different streams
# for jobs subscribers can't tell apart by source. Pulling the dict
# into a shared constant pins the parity at one source-of-truth.
#
# * ``PLATFORMIO_FORCE_ANSI`` covers PlatformIO's own output.
# * ``FORCE_COLOR`` / ``CLICOLOR_FORCE`` cover everything that uses
#   click (esphome itself, esptool, etc.).
# * ``PYTHONUNBUFFERED`` keeps Python subprocesses flushing progress
#   lines (especially ``\r``-terminated ones) instead of buffering
#   them until a ``\n`` arrives.

# OOMing. The gap also keeps the user-visible buffer stable for
# ``cap - keep`` lines at a time so a tail viewer doesn't see
# rapid-fire "..." trim notices on every line. Choosing
