    consumed by both the local subprocess streaming loop in
    :meth:`FirmwareController._execute_job` and the remote-source
    listener in :mod:`controllers.firmware.remote_runner`.

    Steps:

    1. Buffer the line on ``job.output``. CR-terminated chunks
       overwrite the previous entry instead of accumulating, so
       a ninja-driven ESP-IDF build's ~1200 "[N/total] …\r"
       updates don't fill the retention tail with overwritten
       progress lines (#898).
    2. Trim down to ``_INFLIGHT_TRIM_KEEP`` if the in-flight
       cap is hit, so a chatty build doesn't grow ``output``
       without bound between terminal-event trims.
    3. Fan it out as ``JOB_OUTPUT`` so live followers see it.
    4. Parse a coarse 0-100 progress percentage; if it
       advances the previous value, update the job and fire
       ``JOB_PROGRESS`` via :func:`_fire_job_progress`.
       Monotonic-clamp behaviour matches the local subprocess
       path (esptool's "100%" followed by PlatformIO's "0%"
       would otherwise look like a regression to the
       progress-bar renderer). Explicit phase transitions

       the clamp and reset the gauge.
