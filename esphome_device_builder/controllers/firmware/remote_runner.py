"""
Source-routed runner branch for ``JobSource.REMOTE`` firmware jobs.

Lives in its own module so ``controller.py`` stays focused on the
local subprocess pipeline + WS surface. The branch is invoked
from :meth:`FirmwareController._execute_job` when the job's
``source`` field is ``REMOTE``, after ``JOB_STARTED`` has fired
and before chip-verify; it returns once the receiver has emitted
a terminal ``OFFLOADER_JOB_STATE_CHANGED`` (or a translatable
failure path has been finalised locally).

The receiver doesn't know about the offloader-side
:class:`FirmwareJob` — it tracks its own row keyed by its own
``job_id``, and echoes the offloader's id back on every
fan-out frame so the offloader can correlate. We use
``job.job_id`` (the offloader-side id) as the match key on
inbound :class:`OffloaderJobOutputData` /
:class:`OffloaderJobStateChangedData` events.

Listener attach happens **before** ``submit_job`` is sent so an
immediate ``running`` / ``output`` frame from the receiver
can't outrace our subscription. The listener bucket is
process-wide; a stray frame from a different in-flight remote
job lands in a different match-id / pin combination and is
filtered out at the callback boundary.

    Run a REMOTE-source firmware job and finalise *job* on the offloader bus.

    Caller (``FirmwareController._execute_job``) has already
    set ``status = RUNNING`` and fired ``JOB_STARTED``; this
    function is responsible for the entire run-and-finalise
    middle and leaves the outer ``finally`` block to clear
    the lane slot / persist.

    With ``retry_on_server_loss`` (the dispatch pool), a mid-build
    peer-link close raises :class:`RemoteServerLostError` instead of
    finalising FAILED, so the caller can re-route to another worker.

    Dispatches by ``job.job_type``:

    * :attr:`JobType.COMPILE` — submit_job(target="compile"),
      wait for the receiver's terminal frame, finalise based
      on the wire status.
    * :attr:`JobType.UPLOAD` / :attr:`JobType.INSTALL` — same
      compile dispatch (per § Transparent install flow's
      load-bearing "receiver only ever compiles" policy), but
      on receiver-completed pull the artifacts back via
      ``download_artifacts`` and run a local
      ``esphome upload --file <staged_firmware.bin>``
      subprocess to flash the device. INSTALL and UPLOAD
      share this shape — the difference between the two on
      the local subprocess path is "compile-then-upload" vs
      "upload existing artifact", and here the receiver
      already did the compile half.
    * :attr:`JobType.CLEAN` — submit_job(target="clean"). The
      receiver re-extracts the bundle (uniform pipeline with
      compile / upload) then runs ``esphome clean <yaml>``,
      which wipes its ``<data_dir>/build/<device_name>/``.
      No post-completion artifact fetch (nothing built to
      flash); finalise as ``COMPLETED`` on receiver's
      terminal frame. Fan-out from the offloader's local
      ``firmware/clean`` queues one of these per connected
      peer so receivers that built this device locally drop
      their stale artifacts too.
    * :attr:`JobType.RESET_BUILD_ENV` — one bundle-less
      ``reset_build_env`` frame (a full reset carries no
      YAML); the receiver enqueues its own local reset job
      tagged with this job's id, so progress and the terminal
      frame ride the same fan-out as a compile. Finalise like
      CLEAN — no artifacts.

    ``RENAME`` is rejected at the top because the receiver-side
    contract doesn't carry a wire shape for it.
