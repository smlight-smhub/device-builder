"""
Remote build-server pool: bind ``REMOTE_PENDING`` compiles to a free server.

A ``REMOTE_PENDING`` compile (``factories.resolve_install_source``)
holds in ``state.remote_dispatch.pending`` instead of occupying the
single compile lane. One long-lived loop (``run_dispatch_loop``,
gathered in ``FirmwareController._run_queue``) wakes on enqueue, a
peer connecting, or a server freeing, re-snapshots the offloader's
live pairing/queue state, and matches each waiting compile to a free
server — so paired servers compile concurrently and a host paired or
freed mid-queue is used without a fresh ``firmware/install``.

The *which-server* choice is made here at dispatch (not at submit),
which is the whole point: ``pick_dispatch_target`` re-runs against the
current pool every pass, with the servers already driving a job
excluded via ``busy_build_server_pins``.
