    Reads ``source_pin_sha256`` off *job*, looks up the live
    :class:`PeerLinkClient` through the remote-build
    controller, bundles the YAML via the ``esphome bundle``
    subprocess, dispatches ``submit_job(target="compile")``,
    then translates receiver-side ``OFFLOADER_JOB_OUTPUT`` /
    ``OFFLOADER_JOB_STATE_CHANGED`` events into the same
    local ``JOB_OUTPUT`` / ``JOB_PROGRESS`` /
    ``JOB_<terminal>`` fires the local subprocess path emits.
    ``follow_job`` and the firmware-tasks UI consume one
    event stream regardless of which CPU compiled the bytes.

    Dispatches by ``job.job_type``:

    * :attr:`JobType.COMPILE` — wait for the receiver's
      terminal frame, finalise based on the wire status.
    * :attr:`JobType.UPLOAD` / :attr:`JobType.INSTALL` —
      same compile dispatch (per § Transparent install
      flow's load-bearing "receiver only ever compiles"
      policy), but on receiver-completed pull the
      artifacts back via ``download_artifacts`` and run a
      local ``esphome upload --file <staged>`` subprocess
      to flash the device. The local flash step shares the
      ``_tracked_subprocess`` plumbing the LOCAL path uses
      so cancel SIGTERM lands on the upload chain the same
      way.

    Other job types (``CLEAN`` / ``RENAME`` /
    ``RESET_BUILD_ENV``) are rejected at the runner's top
    because the receiver-side ``submit_job`` contract is
    compile-only — these don't have a corresponding wire
    flow.

    Terminal states are mapped through the same helpers the
    local path uses (``job.mark_terminal`` /
    ``_finalize_cancelled``), so the outer
    ``_execute_job``'s ``finally`` runs the shared
    ``_trim_job_output`` / ``_prune_history`` / persist
    sequence regardless of which branch produced the

    Spawn a subprocess that's visible to ``firmware/cancel``.

    Required for every ``create_subprocess_exec`` call in the
    runner path — both the main install/upload spawn in
    ``_execute_job`` and pre-flight probes like
    ``_verify_chip``. Registering in ``state.processes`` is what

    process, no-ops on a missing entry, the user clicks
    Stop, nothing visible happens, and the orphaned subprocess
    runs to completion in the background.

    Two cleanup contracts on exit:

    - Normal exit / non-cancellation exception: restore the
      prior registration so nested usage (a
      future spawn site that itself wraps another) doesn't
      accidentally null out an outer registration.

      ``except asyncio.CancelledError`` in ``_execute_job``
      handles the job-finalisation half and relies on this
