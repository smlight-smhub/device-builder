    1. ``X-Ingress-Path`` header — set by Home Assistant core's
       ingress proxy to the per-token ingress prefix
       (``/api/hassio_ingress/<token>``, no trailing slash). The
       supervisor's ingress proxy passes it through unchanged, so
       the add-on sees the canonical prefix the browser used.
       This is the dominant production deployment shape, so it
       wins over ``X-Forwarded-Prefix`` in the unlikely case both
       headers arrive on the same request.
    2. ``X-Forwarded-Prefix`` header — the standardised reverse-
       proxy signal for non-HA setups (nginx subpath, traefik,
       caddy). Production deployments only set one of the two
       headers in practice; this branch is for the non-HA path.
    3. ``request.path`` minus the matched SPA-fallback tail —
       lets a direct deploy at ``/`` recover the (empty) prefix
       without the operator having to set a header. Caller passes
       the aiohttp ``match_info`` tail in directly so the backend

        Subscribe a connected WS client to real-time events.

        The client receives an initial device list, then ongoing events
        as devices change. Subscription is active for the connection
        lifetime; ``stream_events`` parks in its drain loop until the
        WS closes (cancelling this task), at which point the
        ``EventBus.listening`` context manager inside the helper
        runs its ``finally`` and unsubscribes every listener.

        Previous shapes had two problems addressed here:

        1. The very first version registered listeners then returned,
           leaking ~one listener per ``EventType`` per disconnected
           client. Each leaked listener kept the closed-client
           closure alive, so ``bus.fire`` iterated dead listeners
           forever and bloated the logs with stale-send errors.
        2. The interim shape forwarded events via independent
           ``asyncio.create_task`` calls, so an event fired during
           the ``initial_state`` await raced ahead and arrived
           *before* the snapshot — clients couldn't rely on
           "initial state first, then live updates" ordering.

        ``stream_events`` closes both: listeners attach inside its
        ``with bus.listening`` block before the snapshot is awaited,
        and the bounded queue serialises every event after the seed.

        Backpressure: a queue overflow forces the WS to close
        (``push_or_terminate`` for every event type). A client
        that's fallen 4000+ events behind is already in a broken
        state — its UI is showing wildly stale data — so the
        cleanest recovery is to drop the connection and let the
        client reconnect. ``initial_state`` reseeds device state
        on the new connection; for authoritative job state
        clients use ``follow_jobs`` (which has its own snapshot).
        Selectively keeping log lines or lifecycle events through
        an overflow doesn't actually leave the UI in a usable
        state — the connection is fucked either way.
