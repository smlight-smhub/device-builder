"""DEPRECATED: Legacy REST + WebSocket endpoints for Home Assistant compatibility.

These endpoints exist only for backward compatibility with the HA ESPHome
integration (via esphome-dashboard-api). They will be removed once HA
migrates to the /ws multiplexed API.

HA uses:
- GET /devices (list configured + importable devices)
- GET /json-config?configuration=... (parsed YAML as JSON)
- /compile (WebSocket, spawn protocol)
- /upload (WebSocket, spawn protocol)

GET /ping (``{<config>.yaml: True|False|None}`` online-status map) is
consumed by third-party widgets (gethomepage/homepage) rather than HA
core; it is restored here for backward compatibility with the legacy
dashboard.

The ``/compile`` and ``/upload`` WebSocket handlers route through the
new firmware-job queue rather than spawning subprocesses directly.
This is what makes HA-triggered builds show up alongside dashboard-
triggered ones in the "Firmware tasks" panel — see issue #394. The
legacy WS frame shape (``{event: "line", data}`` / ``{event: "exit",
code}``) is preserved so unmodified ``esphome-dashboard-api``
clients keep working.

    Translate a firmware-job's output stream into the legacy WS frame shape.

    The legacy protocol (the only one HA's ``esphome-dashboard-api``
    speaks) expects ``{event: "line", data: <chunk>}`` per stdout
    chunk and ``{event: "exit", code: <int>}`` once the build
    finishes. The new firmware queue exposes those signals via
    bus events (``JOB_OUTPUT`` / ``JOB_COMPLETED`` / ``JOB_FAILED``
    / ``JOB_CANCELLED``) and a buffered ``job.output`` list.

    Routes through ``helpers.event_bus.stream_events`` for the
    core pipeline (subscribe, bounded drain, listener cleanup on
    cancel). Every wire frame travels the same path —
    ``handle_event`` and ``send_initial`` build a legacy-frame
    dict and push it through ``controls``; ``stream_events``
    drains the queue and ``_LegacyWSWriter`` writes each dict to
    the WS verbatim. No direct ``ws.send_json`` calls outside the
    adapter.

    The snapshot/subscribe race is closed at the call site:

    1. ``snapshot = list(job.output)`` is captured *outside*
       ``stream_events`` — a fresh list copy so a later
       ``_trim_job_output`` reassign of ``job.output``
       (``firmware/helpers.py``) doesn't mutate what we replay.
    2. ``stream_events`` attaches the listener (sync) before any
       ``await`` yields control. No event can fire between the
       snapshot in (1) and the listener attach in (2), so each
       line lands in exactly one of the two — never both, never
       neither.
    3. ``send_initial`` pushes the snapshot frames synchronously
       (no awaits between pushes) so they can't interleave with
       live events that the listener queues after subscribe.

    Capacity: ``stream_events`` defaults to a 4000-slot queue.
    Lines push with drop-on-full (slow follower → drop, no
    bus.fire blocking); the terminal frame pushes with
    ``push_priority`` (force-enqueue, evicts oldest) so the
    exit frame always lands even if the queue is saturated.
